FIRST AMERICAN DECORATION DAY OBSERVED IN CUBA.                             -----  Touching Ceremony in Havana Cemetery in Memory of the Dead                 Sailors of the United States           Battle-ship Blown Up in the Harbor There.                             -----          (Special from a World Staff Correspondent.)           The World, Saturday, March 5, 1898, p. 2                                       Havana, Cuba, March 4.      A little ceremony performed quietly to-day in the grand Colon Cemetery, here will become historic.      It was the first observance of the American Decoration Day in Cuba.      Fifty Americans, a few flowers, a small copy of “Old Glory” and a fervent prayer were all, but the observance was sincere and touching, and it was the first honoring by Americans of America’s dead sailor lads.      Rough piles of disgusting graveyard soil over the burial trenches received half a dozen modest wreaths to- day.  To-morrow massive marbles may see a sea of honoring faces and an important part of the United States mourning the loss of its heroic dead.      The following prologue and signatures tell the little story of what may be a great national observance:               MEMORIAL SIGNED BY PARTICIPANTS.      “We, the undersigned, Americans in Havana, have this day visited the Cemetery of Colon and have decorated the yet unfinished graves of 160 American marines and sailors who perished upon Feb. 15, 1898, in the destruction of the United States man-of-war Maine in Havana Harbor.  May this modest first decoration day become an annual demonstration in Havana of America’s remembrance to American dead.      “FITZHUGH LEE, United States Consul-General.      “JOSEPH A.

Tombocken, of Chicago, and two others.  In a little hotel room they conceived the idea of going to the cemetery and leaving a wreath, thus beginning a custom for all visiting Americans to honor their nation’s dead.  They had no flag, but one bought some cloth, as previously cabled to The World, and some Cuban women made it up into a red, white and blue flag of the correct proportions.  Their meeting ended, but they had “builded better than they knew.”  They have made a national holiday. Gen. Lee aided, and Capt. Sigsbee and Capt. Cowles, of the Fern, also were present.      Some speeches had been prepared, but simplicity was the main idea, so Mr. Mages simply said, as he laid down a wreath upon a little flag, both on dirt heaped over the heroes:      “Fellow-citizens—representing the American visitors in Havana and those resident here, I lay these flowers upon the American flag they honored as a little token of remembrance to our dead sailor lads.  May all Americans visiting Cuba in the future remember the two hundred and sixty here buried.”      Then Chaplain-Chidwick prayed.      The tears came, and then the little file of carriages went their two miles back to Havana with better men inside.      The fifty who went were tourists, members of the American colony and representatives of the American press. 137 The affair was hastily arranged and many members of the American colony were not notified, but it meant a great deal.      Senator Proctor was present.      One body was saved to-day.  Thirty rifles and one unexploded ten-inch shell were also taken out of the wreck.
