OQUENDO JOINS VIZCAYA AND HAVANA IS OVERJOYED.                             -----         Boats Crowded with People Shouting and Firing            Bombs Escort the Frowning Warship to an            Anchorage Near the Ruins of the Maine.                             -----         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)    The World, Sunday, March 6, 1898, p. 1, second edition      HAVANA, Cuba, March 5.ÑThe first-class armored cruiser Almirante Oquendo, a sister ship of the Vizcaya, arrived to-day.      Chartered boats filled with royalists shouting and firing bombs and with bands of music playing met her and escorted her into the harbor, where the water was covered with small craft gayly decorated, and the wharves were packed with people.      As the Almirante Oquendo entered the Vizcaya dressed ship and saluted.  Morro and Cabanas saluted, too. A proper response was made by the Almirante Aquendo, which dropped anchor near the Vizcaya and the remains of the United States battle-ship Maine.      Honore Laine was arrested last night and is again in the dreary Cabanas prison, where he already has spent fourteen slow months.      Laine is a French citizen.  He was imprisoned first on a charge of being a rebel leader.  Life was guaranteed to him from the first by the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, but the trial dragged for more than a year, ending finally in acquittal.
