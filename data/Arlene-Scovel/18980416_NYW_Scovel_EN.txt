KEY WEST CREWS FRET AT DELAY.                             -----               Men Are Impatient at Inaction And                   Discipline Grows Irksome.                             -----                    WISH FOR WAR OR PEACE.                             -----                If Nothing Happens Within Four               Days the Strain May Be Relieved.                             -----                  SHORE LEAVE FOR WEARY MEN.                             -----                Naval Authorities Favor Sending          Them to Land for a Little “Rough Liberty.”                             -----             (Special from a Staff Correspondent.)           The World, Saturday, April 16, 1898, p. 2 KEY WEST, Fla. April 15.—Long delay at high tension point has affected the steadiness of the squadron’s crews.      All expected war last Monday.  All wanted it.  They were eager to try modern guns, ships and American skill against also modern guns, forts and Spain.      Officers and men—marines, jack tars, oilers, firemen and apprentice boys—were tuned to concert pitch.  Day after day dragged by.  Nothing but suspense.      There was a little war news one day, a little peace news the next.      All the men and many of the officers are rasped into irritability.      Discipline is beginning to be somewhat hard to enforce to the highest notch.      All hands want some decided action, war preferred, but definite peace would be better than the strained uncertainty.      The officers are really disappointed.  Even the Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Staff are baffled.  One of these said to-day:      “The longer it goes the less it looks like war.”      Then he sighed and looked melancholy.      The most important naval men here agree that if there is no war within four days the men should be sent ashore for a little “rough liberty” or the fleet should steam south far enough to get shot at.      If there is no let-up in the nervous strain for four or five days more it will be difficult to immediately 247 restore the cool, incisive discipline that makes machine men for machine guns.
