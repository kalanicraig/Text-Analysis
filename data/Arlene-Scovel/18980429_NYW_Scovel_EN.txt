HOW U.S. WARSHIPS SHATTERED                  SPAIN’S FORTS AT MATANZAS.                            ______            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)                The World, April 29, 1898, p. 3   On Board The World’s Despatch Boat Triton, off Matanzas,           April 28, 3 P.M., via Key West, April 28.      The Matanzas sand banks weren’t much to lose, but yesterday’s rousing half hour is really great.  It proves that an American flagship’s, a monitor’s and a cruiser’s guns and gunners can hit a little thing a long way off a great many times, in a very few minutes.  And that’s the whole story.      Yesterday’s 23 minutes showed what a fury of iron hail would sweep the open embrasured Havana big guns clean of their men, could Admiral Sampson have his wish and were the Iowa, Indiana, Terror, Puritan and Amphitrite, followed by the less protected but plentifully armored flagship, cruisers and gun-boats, to team along and form just a short five hundred yards from Havana’s coast batteries a procession of human mowing machines.      Only during their rapid approach would the leading ships be exposed, and then to a bungling fire from guns trained at extreme and unaccustomed angles.  They could hold their own advancing, and once in the third of a mile range, and with every gun, from thirteen-inch to one-inch, and even every rifle, pouring steel, human life ashore would be impossible.  Havana would be taken with little loss.      The world would have learned the real destructive power of modern ships.  International naval armament would advance a big step, and Cuba would be physically free and independent.      They are of the same training as the gunners at Morro, and if the Matanzas gunners lost precision, even if not their valor, at the partial fire of three ships at 700 yards, what fear need be had of Havana’s guns before fourteen ships with full broadsides at 500 yards.  Matanzas Harbor, its forts and positions of our warships are taken from the chart used officially and cabled by The World’s exclusive method of transmitting maps and plans by wire.      Upon learning from its blockading station that 272 Matanzas Harbor was being fortified, Admiral Sampson yesterday morning determined to stop the work.  Arriving off the mouth of the harbor, the Puritan and Cincinnati joined the flagship New York and all slowly entered.      When at a point 3,000 yards west by north from Maya lighthouse, on the eastern bank of the harbor, the New York slowly swung to starboard, her bow pointed about northwest, and the port eight-inch guns looked at Punta Gorda, two streaks of new yellow sand 4,000 yards distant.      No earthworks were visible at Morro Castle, 7,000 yards or nearly four miles away, across Matanzas to the sea.  The port had no other fortifications.      Quarters were sounded and the lithe jackies sprang with a will and a cheer to their posts.  The neat gray ammunition boxes of the rapid-fire guns and the long, dull- looking “common shell” of the 8-inch guns were there.      The gun crews looked at these, then at the yellow white sand, shifted their quids and waited.      It was the high tension of the other day’s approach toward the Italian man of war Giovanni Bausan, when Sampson yet thought her the Oquendo, but the men knew something had to happen this time.  Earthworks in Cuba don’t hoist Italian colors.      It happened at 12.59.  The port waist 8-inch gun sent its whirring projectile and for the first time in years the United States ships had begun shooting to hit men and guns instead of targets.  The sullen Puritan and the smart Cincinnati to N.E. and N.W. and close to the New York signalled enthusiastically.      The Cincinnati’s crew sometimes had kicked at Capt. Chester’s devotion to daily gun practice but now they saw the point and wanted to impress it upon the Spanish.      Harrington, too, thought the Puritan’s 13-inchers were the proper machines to smash hostile batteries and Sampson signalled “Yes.”      Then things got interesting.  The New York’s eight- inch shells had already begun to shoot whitish spumes of the yellow sand, and the Spanish had answered.  Their shots flew high and appeared to Capt. Chidwick as if from field pieces at extreme elevation.  The swarming laborers who vacated after the second shot were probably preparing to install these and the big brass Nanopeon guns The World has said were lately sent from Havana to constitute together the defenses of the port of Matanzas.  Four minutes after the New York’s first big gun, her four-inch and the Cincinnati’s five-inch guns and the Puritan’s thirteen-inch beauties let loose, and there was music. 273 SHOTS FROM THE OTHER SIDE.      After five minutes’ firing upon Punta Gorda battery shots came from Morillo, on the other side, supposedly from the old-fashioned eight-inch breechloading cannon.  All fell short an average of 500 yards.      Thereupon the New York and the Cincinnati turned their attention and their hulls toward the western side of the harbor, and now spouted flame and iron from both broadsides.      Seventeen minutes had passed, and the Punta Gorda stopped.  The Spanish had been plucky, but outclassed.  The Cincinnati ceased firing at 1.21 and the New York fired the last shot of all at 1.22, and yet tenacious Spaniards in Morillo kept plunking away, doing the best they could and no damage.      They were still [. . .] when the ships steamed out. Two hundred and twenty-four shots had been fired in twenty- three minutes from nothing [. . .] four-inch guns.  Almost all had struck [. . .].      The position of the ships was carefully selected and the usual ship channel [. . .] and probable mines were avoided.      Admiral Sampson did not want even legitimate Maine episodes.      The Spanish fired twelve shots and their guns were very slowly served.  The Cincinnati did the best work.      She caught the range on the first shot and kept it. On the New York Gunner’s Mate Myers is said to have done excellent work, and the crew of the after turret and its 8- inch piece.  Some seaway was on, but unusually good work was done.      The Puritan was left very near the scene of action and instructed to reopen fire at the first appearance of pernicious activity in the damaged earthworks and battered castle flanks.      Nothing has been done there to-day, but some one is setting fire to everything burnable on the coast from Matanzas to Havana.      The Spanish troops have often vowed they would leave Cuba, if ever forced to, a mass of ashes.      They may now be [. . .].
