ZALINSKI SAYS A TORPEDO WAS USED.                             -----   The Inventor of the Pneumatic Dynamite Gun, and a Famous  Authority, Says a Torpedo Was Placed Below the Water Line           and Directly Under One of the Magazines.         The World, Thursday, February 17, 1898, p. 2 Capt. Edmund L. Zalinski, U.S.A., retired, inventor of the famous pneumatic dynamite torpedo gun, and known as America’s explosive expert, was asked by a World reporter last night to give his views of the loss of the Maine.      “Of course,” said he, “we cannot make anything definite out of the matter upon the information now in hand.  My opinion is that the explosion was caused by an incendiary.  I am sure that no Spanish official was concerned either directly or indirectly.  It was probably the act of irresponsible fanatics.  Some of the people there hold us North Americans, as they call us, responsible for all their troubles.      “It would not have been very difficult for parties so disposed to have brought about the catastrophe, and that without implying negligence on the part of the officers of the Maine.      “The harbor is filled with small boats plying about, and there is no way of preventing them from plying in a peaceful harbor.      “My idea is that a torpedo was placed below the water line and directly under one of the magazines.      “The force of the primary explosion might have burst through the plates, and the explosion of the contents of the magazine followed.      “I have said only recently that there was great danger of such a happening should one of our vessels lie in Havana Harbor.  We are bitterly hated by some of the unreasoning Spanish, but I reiterate that the Government could have had nothing to do with it.  It may have been the work of one man or a number of men.      “If proper precautions are not taken the same catastrophe might befall the Vizcaya, the Spanish warship now expected here.  Some irresponsible Cuban sympathizers may be spurred on by this mishap to wreck the visitor.  No doubt proper precautions will be taken to avert such a happening, which would naturally be charged to our account, no matter who was guilty.      “This unfortunate event should not form a determining element in the policy to be pursued as to Spain and Cuba.” 35      It is not known whether it resulted from a bomb or torpedo, an explosion in the magazine or the carelessness of officers.      All is conjecture, uncertainty, excitement.      It is known that 253 lives were lost, and that the great white ship lies at the bottom of Havana harbor.      Some were blown to pieces.  The greater number were drowned like rats in a trap.      Many explanations have been advanced as to the cause of the disaster.  Speculation has gone hand in hand with horror over the catastrophe.      The latest theory is that several of the signal rockets became ignited in some way, and the consequent detonation exploded the magazine.      It is now known that there was steam in only two boilers other than that used for the dummy engine.  There were Whitehead torpedoes aboard, but they had dummy heads. There were no lamps near the magazine.  These facts dispose of the explanation previously advanced.      The cause of the blowing up of the ship will not be known until divers go down and examine the wreck.  If their investigation shows that the indenture in the hull is inward, the conclusion that the magazine was exploded by a bomb or torpedo placed beneath the vessel is inevitable.      If the indention is outward, it will indicate that the first explosion was in the magazine.  This will be determined within twenty-four hours. The slightly wounded and unharmed survivors are now being transported in ambulances by the Spanish Sanitary Corps from the hospitals, the cruisers San Ambrosia and Alphonse XIII. and the City of Washington to the Plant Line steamer Olivette, which will arrive in Key West to-night.      The lighthouse tender requested by Capt. Sigsbee has not yet arrived.  It is expected every hour.  It will transport the wounded, who will be accompanied by seventeen officers.      Havana is trembling with excitement over the disaster. The streets are crowded with people in a fever to know how the news affects the people of the United States.      It was at 9.25 last night that a shot was heard.  It might have come from anywhere.      There was an interval of ten seconds.  The City of Washington leaped her cable’s length.  There was a volcano of fire.  Boats, bodies, huge guns, pieces of armor, rigging and spars shot into the air amid the flames and fell in a frightful shower.      The explosion raised these things up.  The Maine 36 plunged diagonally forward, settling slowly in the startled water.  The night air was torn and rent by the shrieks of tortured men. “God help us! God help us!” The cries pierced the dense smoke, piercing the ears of those on the Washington, while the debris from the shattered ship fell about them.      Searchlight[s] were thrown on the broken dismantled Maine.  All who saw the explosion knew that the vessel was doomed.  The common impulse was to lower boats.  Two of those on the Washington were broken to pieces by the falling debris.  The boats from the City of Washington, the Spanish cruiser Alphonso XIII., and the Machina did all they could.  Twenty-four officers out of twenty-six are known to be saved.  Fifty-nine sailors were rescued.  Some of them were horribly mangled.      The Spanish medical corps set to work removing the wounded to San Ambrosia Hospital.  The wounded men displayed magnificent courage and fortitude.      "Hurt? Yes,” said one sailor, “but do you think I’ll show it?”  His legs are shattered and he was in horrible agony.      Nearly all the officers were in the messroom.  Those who were below could get no further than the middle superstructure on deck.  Those who were in the junior mess had to clamber through water and wreckage waist deep. About twenty men in the quarter watch were almo[st] blown to pieces.      The explosion was in the forward magazine.  The main magazine amidships did not explode.  Very few of the sailors escaped.  The water rushed over them and they were drowned almost immediately.      Spaniards seem genuinely sorry.  Capt.-Gen. Blanco and the palace officials express great sorrow. 37                     CONJECTURE IN HAVANA.      Trembling with Excitement---to Make Examinations---     Caring Wounded---Graphic Description of Eye-Witness.                    (Special to The World.)

The World, Thursday, February 17, 1898, p. 8      HAVANA, Feb. 16.—I have just seen twenty-nine sailors of the Maine silently enduring the torture caused by powder-skinned faces and bodies, broken bones and mangled flesh.      They are being well cared for in the military hospital at San Ambrosio here.      The less severely injured are at Alfonso XIII. Hospital.  The other injured men are yet on the steamship City of Washington.      The severely wounded men will have the best of attention also from the men and women of the American colony.      All the injured men show great grit.      You can’t hear a whimper from one of the twenty-nine swathed forms in San Ambrosio Hospital, nor from those anywhere else. The heavy rainfall which immediately followed last night’s horror still continues in a dreary, dismal drizzle. Out in the bay lies the wreck of the once proud Maine.      Her steel upper deck forward has been completely lifted and turned over upon her starboard side.  None of the big guns in the turrets are visible.      The Maine is slightly listed port and all forward of her massive cranes for unloading ship’s boats has completely disappeared.      The big funnels lie flat upon the twisted and gnarled iron braces and pieces of steel deck.      From the funnels aft the ship seems to be intact.  She has settled until the water has covered the top of her superstructure and the stern searchlight and one rapid-fire gun look over the water just below them.      The only things in place aboard the hulk are the bodies of the men the rushing waters caught while they slept in their hammocks.      There are few sharks now in the bay.  The awful explosion drove them away and they are to be driven out upon a possible reappearance by solid shot fired into the water near the wreck.      Most if not all the bodies will be recovered.      The bay is filled with boatloads of curious people near the upturned mass of steel, iron and mangled humanity.      Two bodies were recovered this forenoon.  The authorities say they are those of Junior Lieut. Jenkins and Assistant Engineer Merritt.      The Spanish authorities are keeping a strict guard with three patrol boats, vigilant lookout being kept for bodies.  The cause of the explosion is ascribed to bursting boilers, a lamp explosion in the magazine, and the explosion of a Whitehead torpedo on board.      The event is deplored and the general hope is expressed that false construction may not be placed on the event.      Capt. Sigsbee’s figures are: 354 on board all told—26 officers, 289 sailors and 39 marines.      Dead now reported: Two officers; uninjured crew, 18; wounded saved, 59; total saved, 101.      Out of fifty-nine injured not over four are likely to die.      All but five officers go to-day to Key West.  All, the slightly wounded and all the able-bodied men go also.      No officer at the Consulate or on shipboard slept last night.  They were busy saving lives.  Estimating the loss and theorizing as to how the accident occurred.      A few able-bodied survivors will be kept here to identify the bodies when they are secured by the first diver obtainable.      The officers remaining will stop at the Hotel Inglaterra. Among the saved on board the City of Washington is a Gustav G. Dressler, of the Maine, who has lost both his eyes.      The passengers of the City of Washington gave up their staterooms to injured men of the American warship.      An iron truss from the Maine fell on the pantry of the City of Washington, breaking and smashing the table ware.      The following sailors are in San Ambrosio.  All but three will live; one man couldn’t give his name:      Dan Cronin, New York; William McGinnis, Boston, John Soffey, Boston; A. Hallen, Brooklyn; James Rol, New York; Francisco Cahill, Massachusetts; Joe Koena, Boston; Fred Gernee, New Brunswick, N.J.;  Charles A. Smith, Jeremiah Shea, Alfred Herns, Norway; J.H. Bloomer, Portland; Alf Johnson, Swede; Carl Bergman, Brooklyn.      B.R. Wilbur, Philadelphia; Charles Pilcher, Buffalo;                             Karl Christianson, Swede; Edward Mattson, Swede; George Fox, Grand Rapids, Mich; A. Ericson, Swede; John E. While, Brooklyn; John Heffron, Brooklyn;  Holzer, Fred C., New York; William Matteson, Bay City, Mich.; H. Judson, St. Luis; W. Allen, Brooklyn.
