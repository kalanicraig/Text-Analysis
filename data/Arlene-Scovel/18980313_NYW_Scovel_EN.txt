MAINE COURT WORKING ON THE WORLD’S DISCOVERY.                             -----         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)            The World, Sunday, March 13, 1898, p. 2                                            Havana, March 12.      The American Naval Court of Inquiry did little work this afternoon.      It probably is awaiting further reports from Ensign Powelson as to the exact position of the Maine’s telltale ram.      All the latter part of the day Olsen’s air bubbles were rising. Capt. Chidwick and Lieut.-Commander Potter were on the Government barge for an hour early this morning. Immediately after their arrival diving began in the peculiar locality described in my despatch yesterday to The World.      The members of the court watched the operations with great interest.      They also listened attentively to Associated Press correspondent Johnston’s explicit account of what the head of the Spanish court, Capt. Peral, had told him as to the discoveries of the Spanish divers, the great difficulty of working in the deep mud and why the Maine’s magazines blew up and destroyed her.      Capt. Sampson is looking better.      Grave members of the Court of Inquiry laughed heartily to-day.  The lines which have deepened in their faces within the last two weeks broadened into wrinkles of jollity over the report in a New York newspaper that Lieut.-Commander Potter—is under the thumb of Capt. Chidwick, his superior officer when on board the warship New York, and that the junior in rank will be influenced unduly.      The sensational report seems to have no foundation whatever.      The risibilities of the board were provoked again by a report in the same newspaper that some of the Maine’s guns probably had been so badly [. . .] by the explosion as to require to be annealed or practically recast.  The guns in question never were cast; they were built up from a centre tube by shrunken rings of steel.      The cruiser Montgomery’s discipline is exquisite.  No one is allowed on board except representatives of the 162 American press and Spanish officers on visits of courtesy.      Capt. Converse has fulfilled punctiliously all the requirements of etiquette, even calling upon the Autonomist-Cabinet, which returned the call immediately.      The harbor is gay with brightly cleaned warships.  The English gunboat Cordelia is expected daily.      Miss Barton’s hospital for children is a pronounced success, of course, and the general condition of the island is somewhat ameliorated, but four times the present outflow of American charity could be well and humanely expended.      The Bishop of Havana is much pleased with the charity work.
