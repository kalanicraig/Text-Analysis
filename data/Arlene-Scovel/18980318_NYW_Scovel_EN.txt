MONTGOMERY LEAVES HAVANA.                             -----         Lighthouse Tender Fern Returns from a Charity              Trip and Takes the Cruiser’s Place.         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)            The World, Friday, March 18, 1898, p. 1      HAVANA, Cuba., March 17,--The United States cruiser Montgomery left Havana harbor this afternoon. The little Fern, which returned from a quick business- like trip to Matanzas and Sagua la Grande with supplies for the reconcentrados, takes the cruiser’s place as headquarters for the naval officers here. When the Montgomery unmoored her tars and marines were lined up facing the nearest Spanish ship, the handsome Vizcaya. The latter’s marines were drawn up also, in accordance with accepted naval usage. The Montgomery rounded the Viscaya’s bow and passed also the bow of the Almirante Oquendo, whose marines also stood at attention.      I saw the dipping of colors here, but am unable now to say which ship lowered first.  Somebody made a mistake which will cost some officer his commission.      International usage demands that a warship shall lower its flag to another, no matter what the circumstances may be. The Montgomery’s flag was lowered and raised, and so was the Oquendo’s. I was too late to verify which dipped first, and upon this point—so great a breach of naval etiquette is it—depends the official head of some lieutenant and, perhaps, an international argument.
