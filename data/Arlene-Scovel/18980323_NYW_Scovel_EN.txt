YELLOW FEVER MAY BE SPAIN'S ALLY.-----Her Divers Are Waiting Until Havana's Deadly Climate Compels Americans to Leave—May Then Find Whatever They Please in the Wreck of the Maine. -----(Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World, Sent from Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer.) On Board The World's Despatch Steamer, Triton.          The World, Wednesday, March 23, 1898, p. 3                                     Havana Harbor, March 22.      In a zinc-lined pine box upon the stern of the Spanish floating morgue barge lies the American sailor Bergensen. All the morning efforts were made to secure permission for The World's despatch boat to take the body to Key West for burial.  The health authorities there were wired early.  No answer was received.  It is now too late for transportation by The World boat, and the men on the wrecking tugs and barges are undecided whether to bury their comrade in Havana or to send the body by the Plant line to-morrow morning for burial in Key West's American soil.      The whole wrecking crew objects to the idea of the man being buried here under existing circumstances.  They say:      "Bergensen was an American seaman in the employment of the United States Government and his body should rest in American soil as well as the Maine victims."      The death has cast a deep gloom over the wreckers. Even although not one minute of work has been lost and half masted flags only show that a man has died, still the sight of the pine box only a few hundred yards distant has taken the sap out of the men.  Their work has been frightful at best, and now that they labor in the midst of new death as well as old they do it mechanically.      To-morrow Chaplain Chidwick is to read the services for the dead aboard the death barge which has borne so many American sailors.  All hands will knock off work for the moment, and proper observance will be made.  The ceremony will occur whether the body is taken ashore or to Key West for burial.      Dr. Dudly asserts positively that Bergensen's death was not from yellow fever or other infectious disease.  It is well that such is the case, for the sickly season is rapidly approaching, when work will be extremely hazardous for unacclimated Northerners, and as the Spanish divers now 199 say:      "We will have the work all to ourselves."      The Spanish divers are now hardly working at all. They descend every other day for not over an hour at a time.  When the Americans are forced to cease work then the Spanish board may be expected to report that the investigation is incomplete and demand time for further work.  The World is able to produce testimony, and the American divers know that the Spanish investigations up to date have only indorsed the discoveries of our own men.      But when Americans are unable to keep check upon Spanish work statements may be expected which the Spanish divers working alone will be easily able to create foundations for.      In short, if Spain is allowed time to finish her investigations before the United States make reclamation the strong probability is that they will then be presented with Spanish claims backed by alleged Spanish discoveries which will be used as ground for demanding an international board and the delay which Spain so badly needs.      The Maine's first steam cutter raised shows her side smashed in by a blow from heavy wreckage.  The forward part is uninjured.  The cutter was riding moored to the starboard boom about opposite the big magazine.  Had this exploded not only would the men not have been saved, but experts believe every bit of the cutter would have been demolished.      Already two 6-pounders and two 6-inch breech-loading cannons have been raised.  Even one which had been on the forward superstructure and which has been scorched seems uninjured.  Experts think all are practically undamaged. Two more 6-inch guns it is expected will be raised to- morrow.  Mr. Klopech asks for 300 tons of cornmeal and 50 tons of bacon weekly to feed all.  This class of food only hungry people will eat.  It is not likely to be stolen and will save the starving country people of Cuba.  It would cost $15,000 weekly.      The Havana press again breaks out against American correspondents.  American food for Cubans is also objected to in a vigorous manner.  It is evident that a daily propaganda has been established in favor of letting Cubans starve.      Much anxiety is felt here over the effect of the expected report that the Maine was blown up.  The volunteers are not yet persuaded to deposit their arms in armories.      The general situation is most depressing.                              200      CUBA ALREADY SAVED FROM EXTINCTION BY OUR CHARITY.                             -----   Food for All the Starving and Enough to Last Until Crops      Can Be Raised Is on the Island Now or Soon Will Be.                             -----               FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY ONE                 PEOPLE IS SUSTAINING ANOTHER.                             -----    (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World, Sent            from Havana to Key West by The World's                   Despatch Steamer Triton.)         On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Triton,          The World, Wednesday, March 23, 1898, p. 4                                     Havana Harbor, March 22.      The Americans are feeding all the starving Cubans now.      Spain must stop complaining or allow them to work. The tools and the seed and the ground are here; all that is needed is permission.      Half a million possible Cubans had starved up to last October, and half a million more were starving.      The farms set apart by Weyler for their support were not cultivated except in tobacco and sugar.  Absolutely nothing was being done for the hundreds of thousands of innocent persons, mostly women and children, who were perishing slowly and miserably.  A few bits of food from the few Cuban families who had it to give and slim charity from one out of a thousand Spanish merchants was something --and yet nothing.      Since then hundreds have died.  They were too far gone for food to help them.      But hundreds of thousands have been saved.  They could eat.      Within ten days, as fast as railroads and steamships can carry it, there will be American food in Cuba for every destitute person.  A whole starving people will be fed by another people.  For the first time in history one nation will be taking sole and complete care of the charges of another.      Other famous relief movements have succeeded many, but this feeds all.                 SPANIARDS GNASH THEIR TEETH.      The very Spanish press admits it and is bitter over the fact.  La Lucha of yesterday says: 201      “We have been unable to find in history a case of one state sustaining the necessities of another state.”      What the Spaniards hate intensely, what The World foretold long ago, and what the most brilliant Havana daily is the first paper here to confess, is, as La Lucha puts it, “not that starving Cubans are being made well, but that they are being made into Americans."      That paper continued:  “A stomach full of cornmeal is a stronger bid for allegiance than twenty thousand bannered forts and two hundred thousand soldiers.  And the fact that American bacon and cornmeal are now as general over Cuba as Spanish flags and bayonets makes the Cuban feeling universal.”      After noting the sharp contrast between the great governmental carnivals in Spain and the great American succor to starving Spanish subjects in Cuba, La Lucha says:           $50,000 APPROPRIATION THE ENTERING WEDGE.      “Not only have our neighbors not forgotten, but they have augmented their charity, which is immense, and each day it promises to be greater in attaining the ends which its beginners and supporters have in mind.  The truth is it began in a small Government donation of $50,000.  Later there was a distribution of small quantities of food, then of clothes, medicines and other things.  To-morrow this charity will have organized throughout the island great economic kitchens and hospitals capable of feeding and sheltering each its hundred of persons.      “How beautiful is charity!  Do you not think so?  And all this has been realized without noise, without machinery of any kind, with a modesty which really causes admiration and respect, and which we all ought to applaud--that is to say, all of us who are not men of government.  We ought not to see in these great humane actions which our neighbors are doing with the greatest disinterestedness and solely upon impulse of their generosity, any other end, than humane actions, frequently forgotten in their own country.”            NEWSPAPERS ARE VIRULENT IN OPPOSITION.      The Spanish papers have been virulently attacking American charity for some time.  All have repeatedly made the point that in feeding all the hungry Cubans, America is making a permanent and great pauper class.      This is the one great fact used by all to force the liberal-minded Gen. Blanco to curtail the privileges already granted and to refuse any new requests.      This clamor has caused the Captain-General to decide not to allow the Americans to completely cure the ill.  He now refuses to allow the hungry to work, refuses to permit 202 Cubans to use American tools and American bought seed in raising their own food.      Cuban soil is not to be allowed to support Cubans. Spain will condemn every one of the destitute to die unless she permits American charity to continue.  Spain forces the very thing she objects to by refusing to allow Cubans to support themselves.      Blanco seems to have been compelled to outdo Weyler. Weyler established zones of cultivation about the concentrated towns, but Blanco so far has refused to let the American Cuban Relief Committee put tools and seeds in the reconcentrados' hands.               SELF-SUPPORT VIRTUALLY FORBIDDEN.      Were Weyler's zones of cultivation only cultivated, were the people allowed to help themselves, American charity would soon become superfluous in Cuba.  There would be no pauper class, as indeed there never was on the rich Cuban soil in peace times, and the Spaniards could then demand the withdrawal of outside assistance without insulting humanity.      The present great work is the result of publicity, knowledge, sympathy, money, and lately of vigorous and good management.      When Weyler ordered the country people into the towns many prophesied sad results, but not one foretold Cuba's losing half her population by starvation and its attendant diseases.  No one paid attention even to the facts sustaining such a prophecy.  It took the proofs of photographs, of Spanish prelates, of Spanish statements, and even of the Spanish press, to convince, and conviction came after half a million unarmed people had died.      Then The World printed daily actual photographs and hard facts.      Soon President McKinley issued his appeal and appointed a good committee, after which food began coming in all forms and in quantities.      Then Clara Barton arrived, and food came in greater quantities and in much more acceptable quality.      Now seven hundred and fifty tons of cornmeal and bacon are on the way to the hungry ones by sea, and hundreds of tons more are passing through Cuba by rail, so that the two hundred and twenty reconcentrado towns of Cuba will be supplied within a week with food for all.              EXTENT OF BENEVOLENCE NOT REALIZED.      Since then American charity has poured forth to an extent which I believe is not generally understood.      It is true that within ten days no one in Cuba need 203 hunger.  Their food will be coarse, but sufficient.      From the time when a humane Cuban doctor took me to Los Fosos, in October, when Weyler was still here, and well-to-do Cubans smuggled a few cots and food into that charnel-house, fearing expulsion if found out, American charity has come with a rush.      First a few boxes of old clothing were sent by New York women to Gen. Lee.      Next came a quick answer to the good Bishop Santa Ander's plea.      President McKinley's Cuban relief committee has done wonderful work.  Its representative here, Mr. Louis Klopsch, arrived a week ago to find large quantities of foodstuffs undistributed, and some friction between Gov. Bruzon's government committee and Miss Barton's assistants. Mr. Klopech immediately reduced the committees to two men-- one American and one Cuban--whom he personally knew had experience and who understood one another.  The piled-up provisions were sent out immediately, and what was lacking was purchased.      Mr. Klopsch had done similar work before.  When a Spanish milk dealer came with bitter complaints that the price of that article had declined from 20 to 8 cents a can, Mr. Klopsch said:      “Is that so?  Then I will take all you have at that price.”      The merchant never came back.      To each reconcentrado town is being sent cornmeal and bacon sufficient for ten days at a pound a day for each person.                EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION ASSURED.      The names of good people have been secured in most towns, and where none are available the Mayor has been made the consignee.  Almost all the Mayors under the new regime are Cubans and naturally will see that the food goes to its proper destination.      But if some should be dishonest, the sort of provisions sent, though sufficient to save life, are not very salable, and the Mayor could much better afford to give it away than to steal it.      Corps of inspectors from among willing workers in Havana are to make tours to inspect the food.  There is plenty of it.  Now that America feeds the Cubans, let Spain allow them to plant and cultivate the food which in two months of rapid growth in this climate will be ample to sustain them.
