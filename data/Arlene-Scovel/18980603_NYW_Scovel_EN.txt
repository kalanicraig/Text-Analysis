WORLD’S DESPATCH BOAT SAILS AROUND CUBA.                             -----      No Spanish Warships Interrupt the Trip, but United        States Men-of-War Dotted the Seas and Harbors,               Keeping Up an Effective Blockade.                             -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)             The World, Friday, June 3, 1898, p. 3      KEY WEST, June 2—On Board The World’s Despatch Boat, June 1.—This little vessel has just finished the first complete tour of the Cuban coast made by a newspaper boat and has discovered no Spanish warships in harbor or on the high seas other than the minor vessels which have been in port since the war began.  In all 1,586 miles were covered.      Tuesday noon, May 24.  The World’s despatch boat steamed from Key West eastward.  Next day the wind blew half a hurricane.  The despatch boat was supplied with extra provisions and has a heavy deckload of coal besides full bunkers.  She made very bad weather, but wallowed and pitched safely through while the fine fruit steamer Belvedere was piling upon the rocks to the south of Cape Maysi.      When two nights later we passed the cape’s lighthouse it was alit.  Whether it was in operation when the Belvedere ran ashore we do not know.  Wednesday afternoon Admiral Sampson’s fighting ships in line, flanked by light cruisers, came foaming westward along toward Havana.  They were about twenty miles north of Frances Key and the monitors were seas under half the time.  Following the warships was the usual flock of newspaper dispatch boats.      Leaving the fleet plunging westward, we continued bucking the sea toward Cape Maysi.  Wednesday night a big fine-looking craft sent a shot across our bow, and, ranging up alongside, proved to be the New Orleans.  None but a land lubber could mistake the new cruiser, with her searchlight above her fighting troops, for any other American ship afloat.      Shortly after daybreak Thursday morning, with Puerto Padre port deserted on our starboard beam, a pursuing smoke rapidly developed into an American warship.  The usual mandatory white bow puff of smoke from the chaser was quickly followed by the shriek of a six-pounder between the masts of our boat and not fifteen feet above the deck. When the Dolphin came close past us her officer of the deck, Lieut. Coles. megaphoned quietly: 306      “How near did we come to you?”      For three miles’ range they came near enough.      Thursday afternoon Neuvitas Lighthouse strung signal flags as we passed.  Although some steamer smoke appeared to rise from the harbor, no Spanish gunboat came out.  They probably had not recovered from their narrow escape the other day from two American cruisers  Nuevitas Lighthouse has the word Colon upon it.  There is where Columbus first touched America. Friday afternoon a northbound “tramp” steamer proved to be the Kong Frode of Norway, bound from Port Antonio, Jamaica, to Philadelphia. I signaled: “I wish to communicate with you,” and the steamer changed her course to approach us. Her decks were full of miscellaneously clad people. They were the shipwrecked crew and passengers of the wrecked steamer Belvedere.      On board was the manager of the well-known American bookstore of Havana.  He had escaped from its chief of detectives, Trufilo Monaga, six days before, and had reached Jamaica via Cienfuegos and a refugee ship.  The Kong Frode refused to stop, and the only answer we had time to receive as to how Havana is faring was, “Everything gone.”      Saturday afternoon The World’s despatch boat was steaming along the south coast.  No warship of either combatant had been seen in the eastern passage.  Suddenly from under the very base of the high mountain “cordillera” came black smoke.  Soon the hull of a ship came into vision as a black speck.  It was Spanish gunboat colors, and the place the pursuer came from was Santiago, where there are several Spanish cruisers.  So the big engineer screwed down the safety-valve, and three stokers trebled the fireroom force and she pushed water toward Jamaica at full ten-knot speed.  The pursuing ship began to grow as her fires took hold, and in about half an hour had gained fully ten miles on us.  She was the St. Paul.  We tempered the disappointment of her crew by packages of late New York newspapers.      Capt. Sigsbee said that he had been close under Santiago’s guns but had not been fired at.  Upon hearing that the Dolphin had told us that official news placed the Spanish fleet in Cienfuegos, where Schley had it fast, Sigsbee smiled and asked how in the world they knew.  Some wag answered:  “The Board of Strategy put ‘em there,” and Sigsbee smiled.      The St. Paul’s crew were elated over their capture of the British collier Restormel just as she was entering 307 Santiago.      They also were rejoiced to receive newspapers and they gave three hearty cheers for The World’s despatch boat as we left them.  We came about Cape Santa Cruz and close to the shore toward Cienfuegos at dawn of Monday.  Not a sail nor smoke was in sight.  Another Montserrat, with tons of armor-piercing projectiles and food, or even the looked-for Alfonso XIII., might have easily entered and unloaded its cargo just twelve hours by rail from Havana on the same line which supplies Matanzas, Santa Clara, Caradenas, Sagua la Grande and all of Spain’s principal bases.  The St. Paul was distant over twenty-four hours’ steam even at top speed toward Cienfuegos.  A blockade runner from Jamaica would have had an easy trip.      Yesterday afternoon a steamer passed us hull down apparently bound for Jamaica.  To-day, as we skirted the north coast opposite Mariel, an armed lighthouse tender shot close across our bows.  The six-pound shell was well timed and burst even with our position.  Our captain had neglected to fly his ensign, nor was our vessel signal flying.  Neither did he change our course at once, but kept on straight for the tender, exactly as a Spanish gunboat might have done, and it was rather exciting.      Finally, before the tender turned her bow gun loose again to hit, the captain threw the despatch boat’s bow around.  She stopped and all hands breathed more freely. We had been out of the world for eight days.  Havana or even Key West might have been bombarded for all we knew. We asked what had occurred, and the answer, “Nothing at all,” came floating over the Gulf Stream.
