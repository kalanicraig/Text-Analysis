WAR SPIRIT HIGH IN CUBAN CAPITAL.-----Even Fifteen-Year-Old Boys Enlisting—The City Streets Turned Into Drill Grounds.-----THE PEOPLE WILDLY EXCITEDBY ALL SORTS OF RUMORS.-----Capt.-Gen. Blanco Making Frenzied Efforts to Put Defenses in the Best Possible Shape, Looking For Bombardment and Invasion.-----(Special from a World Staff Correspondent.)      (By courier from Havana to Mariel, on the coast, by           World’s Despatch Boat Triton to Key West,                     and thence by cable.)            The World, Sunday, April 24, 1898. p. 3      On board the Triton, fifteen miles north of Mariel, Cuba, daybreak. April 23.—Havana is making a tardy, frenzied effort to prepare for war with the United States.      When The World correspondent left there last night— running the gauntlet of city guards, regular troops massed outside the city and the scouting guerillas—to get this uncensored dispatch to The World, the whole city of Havana was in a state of the wildest excitement.      Ten ships of the United States Navy were off Havana at sunset.  People expected the bombardment to begin this (Saturday) morning.  The wildest reports were circulated in Havana and were credited.  It was believed that the whole United States Army was on its way in transports from the Gulf ports.      There were predictions that the actual invasion of Cuba might begin by Sunday.  The newspapers have no reliable news.  Cable communication with Key West is not cut off, but of course the Spaniards refuse to believe any news that now comes to them over that cable from Key West. They suspect that it is cooked at the American end to fool Havana.      The World’s Havana correspondent met near Mariel the venturesome World correspondent Heilburg, whose landing on the coast was made from The World’s dispatch boat Triton last Tuesday, as described in a previous despatch.  These two correspondents not only got the first real news from 258 Havana since the departure of Gen. Lee, but they secured confidential information for Rear-Admiral Sampson.                 HAVANA’S ANTIQUATED DEFENSES.      In Havana men are at work day and night adding to the fortifications.  Old-time brass cannon which saw service many years ago are being put in place to splice out the sea batteries.  They would not be dangerous, as a matter of fact, even if Secretary Long should allow Rear-Admiral Sampson to do his fighting at 800 yards instead of 3,000, as Sampson wished.      But no extra armament of modern style and weight has been added to the fortifications.  The Spaniards have not the guns.      The rumor that four new twelve-inch Krupp guns had been mounted to the east of Morro is without foundation. The truth is the guns are on their way and the mounts for them are rapidly nearing completion, and if the attack upon Havana is delayed much longer the Cojimar batteries will really be formidable.      A pontoon bridge has been built across Chorrera Inlet, in the western suburbs of Havana, for the transportation of sand for the embankments of the two-Vedido and Santa Clara batteries.  This work is not completed and as matters now stand one twelve-inch shell might disable the two big guns if it struck the still bare masonry.      A two-inch water pipe is being laid under the neck of Havana Harbor to supply Morro, Cabanas and the Cojimar batteries.  Alarm was spread in Havana at the beginning of this work by the display of a signal on Morro reading, “Harbor closed.”  Every one thought at once that the American fleet was at hand, but the signal was only for the protection of the pipe layers.      There are hourly drills in all the batteries, but there is no more firing of the guns in target practice, on account of a lack of ammunition.  Gen. Blanco deems it wise to save all his projectiles and powder for the day of actual need.  He is reported to be short of ammunition already.      With the single exception of the sand protection then, the defenses of Havana have not been materially strengthened thus far, although long lines of work are underway.                  SPANISH WARSHIPS AT HAVANA.      On April 21 these Spanish warships were in the harbor:      ALFONSO XII., second-class cruiser.—This vessel will not be able to move for a month on account of tubes for her boiler or condenser having been stolen.  They cannot be 259 replaced here.LEGASPI.—This is a transport. She is very slow and carries only two small guns.      NUEVA ESPANA.—This second-class gunboat came out of the floating dock only four days ago.FILIPINAS.—Torpedo gunboat. Her machinery is useless. It was ruined by Spanish engineers on her first trip from the shops in England. MAGELLANES.—Gunboat. Her machinery is still repairing. The machinists at work on her are waiting for parts that cannot be made in Havana.      INFANTA ISABEL.—Second-class cruiser.  The work of repairing her machinery is progressing slowly.      MARQUES DE ENSENADA.—Second-class cruiser.  Under repairs.      ANTONIO LOPEZ.—Fourth-class gunboat.  The only serviceable craft in the harbor.  She has been doing patrol duty along the coast. The Spanish authorities on April 21 claimed that there were 25,000 soldiers in the city of Havana able for service in defending the land approaches. The truth is that there are probably less than half that number. One battalion reached Havana on the 16th, one on the 17th, two on the 18th and four on the 19th and 20th. Allowing five more for the 21st, and adding the regular Havana garrisons, the total is less than 12,000.      The arriving troops are filthy and ragged, but they are strong and full of patriotism.  In fact, there is a warlike spirit everywhere.  The streets of the city have been turned into drill grounds and offices have been opened for enlistment.      Courier Holmes says:      “Don’t make the mistake of thinking they won’t fight. Why, even fifteen-year-old boys are enlisting; and they mean business too.”      Prices of all kinds of food shot up 20 per cent on the 13th, 5 per cent on the 15th and 10 percent on the 21st. And even at these high prices it is almost impossible to buy.      Army rations, however, and coal are pouring into Havana.      On April 18 the steamship Reina Maria Christina brought as a gift from the Spaniards in Mexico 6,534 sacks of cornmeal, beans, rice and coffee.      On the same day there was a panic over a tremendous drop in silver.  Even before that $4.75 in gold brought $7 in silver and about $14 in paper money.  Really no business 260 is being done, as all the men are either drilling or counting their losses.      On April 20 there were over 85,000 tons of coal on the wharves besides the cargoes of three big vessels which were discharging.  Four other vessels with coal are on their way to Havana.      The consurate of the press is now stricter than ever. Unfavorable cablegrams about the action of the American Congress and the President were held for days and then allowed to slip out gradually.                 UNCHECKED ABUSE OF AMERICANS.      The abuse of Americans is now universal and unchecked. The World and its correspondents are particularly remembered.      News of the final action at Washington caused a great popular burst of indignation, followed by a whirlwind of patriotism.  The Spaniards in Havana declared that they had been insulted, and had there been any Americans left in the city, and known as such, they would surely have died.      Great crowds surrounded the Governor-General’s palace and thronged the parks.  La Guerra (war) was the frenzied word.      One man became so delirious that, to show what he would like to do to the hated Yankees, he sank his teeth into his bare arm and swallowed the blood.      The rebel forces have received large accessions.  The native Cubans feared there would be a draft by the Spanish officials, and they preferred to fight with their friends rather than against them.  It is estimated that more than 2,000 have gone into the field since April 13, and many have been sent back by the leaders.      There is no food for some and no arms for many.  The Cubans that have been sent back rejected have gone into the Spanish mobilized forces, but they won’t fight very hard.                   CUBANS ANXIOUS TO FIGHT.      Col. Pedro Delgado, who is in command of a band of insurgents operating near Mariel, told The World courier, Mr. Heilburg, “that all he wanted was good guns and plenty of ammunition.”  He said he wanted to fight some.  He was tired of running away.      As matters now stand he and almost every other Cuban leader is compelled to confine resistance to mere outpost skirmishing and to retreat when only a few of the precious cartridges have been fired.      If these men, who have fought three years of the hardest war in recent history, were supplied with the discarded but accurate Springfield United States Army 261 rifles and sufficient cartridges, but few American regulars would be needed to take Havana from the land side.      All that the Cuban soldiers ask is arms.  All they want to do is to help.  Several thousand suits of cheap drilling would make them more comfortable these chilly nights.      The territory covered by Delgado’s band has been mapped and described in The World as “the hardest place in Cuba for the Cubans.”  It is swarmed over by Spanish foot and horse from many nearby towns and fortified villages, yet there are more Cuban soldiers there now than there were when I last reported on the district in October, 1897.      When I landed at Mariel to receive the courier despatches from Havana there were a dozen insurgents from Delgado’s band on the shore.      Spanish papers claim that the Cubans do not want American intervention.  But when I told these ragged, earnest men what the President had said to Spain they could not believe it for sheer joy.  They embraced all around, and I felt it was worth while to carry such news to such men.      As for Gen. Blanco’s armistice, so solemnly talked about in Europe and enunciated in Cuba, it is a farce; more so, even, than Cuban autonomy.      Col. Delgado had two skirmishes yesterday, his camp being attacked by a Spanish column.  Several men were killed on both sides, and Mr. Holmes helped to bury them.      The comic-opera side of Spanish official peace in Cuba is shown by the fact that after the promulgation of Gen. Blanco’s decree an uninstructed news bureau sent out official statements of several brilliant Spanish victories. One of them, it was announced, was won not four miles from the spot where The World’s dispatch boat made its landing.                 TREATING WITH THE INSURGENTS.      On April 17 the Autonomy Commission, composed of Senors Dolz, Giberga, Rabell and Sola, left Havana for Santa Cruz del Sur, which is close to the stations of the Cuban Government.  It was no secret that they went officially to inform the Cuban leaders that American intervention was only a mask for speedy annexation.      It is not thought, however, that they will make any impression even if they are not put to death, in accordance with the Cuban rule, which applies the death penalty to all that endeavor to treat with Cubans on any basis other than complete independence.      The condition of the reconcentrados is horrible, and Weyler’s plan of extermination will succeed if invasion is 262 long delayed.  The American rations already issued from the warehouses lasted until April 17.  Since then they have had nothing, as the Government has confiscated all the food for the troops.      The gift of supplies from the Spaniards in Mexico was also for the army and navy, although at the time of its presentation the Havana press stated that it was for the poor.      Still, with all their mediaeval manners, their childish vanities and their windy bombast, the Spanish residents of Havana have to a man responded to their country’s call.  They will be beaten.  I believe, not through their cowardice, but through their Dark Age ignorance.  They are not alert and up to the times.                   THE WORLD BOAT’S CRUISE.      For example, The World’s despatch-boat Triton has made four daylight trips, almost in touch with the Cuban coast near Havana, studying and noting strategic points.  During the last week representatives of The World have explored, noted and photographed every rod of Cuban coast from Matanzas to Mariel.      Commanders of the Spanish forts have seen me disembark.  The Havana newspapers have howled over “the Triton in Mariano Bay.”  We were aground half of one night, and yet only one feeble attempt was made to catch us, although the Spanish officials knew we were illegally within the three-mile limit, and although they knew the work we were doing would damage them when war came.      Even though they knew the Triton would be a desirable acquisition for the Spanish auxiliary fleet, they came for us only in a lazy sort of way, which a New York schoolboy could easily have baffled.  As Mr. Holmes says:      “The Spaniards are as cruel as they are brave, and they are as stupid as they are cruel.”
