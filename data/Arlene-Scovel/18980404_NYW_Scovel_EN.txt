SPAIN PLANTS 40 MINES IN HAVANA HARBOR.                             -----     Two Lines of the Spherical Sort Floating Twenty-four    Feet Below the Surface in the Channel at the Entrance.                             -----             SECRETLY LAID AT NIGHT, AND ANCHORED               TO CABLE BETWEEN MORRO AND PUNTA.                             -----      But an Attacking Fleet Might Clear the Way for Its        Advance by Means of Counter Mines or Torpedoes           Fired from the Bows of Advancing Vessels.                             -----    (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World.  Sent   from Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer.)         On Board the World's Despacth Steamer Triton.             The World, Monday April 4, 1898, p. 1                                      Havana Harbor, April 3.      Forty floating submarine mines were secretly planted in Havana Harbor last Wednesday night by the Spanish Government.      This information comes from official sources and is absolutely correct.      The mines were laid in the narrowest part of the channel between Morro and Punta, in two lines of twenty mines each.      They are spherical and float about twenty-four feet under the surface.      Each is attached by an anchor chain to a heavy cabled anchored at the bottom.      The detonating wires run up the chains.      There is sufficient force there to paralyze the biggest ships afloat.      But if an entering fleet should use counter-mines or bow torpedoes on approaching the narrowest part of the entrance to the harbor the mines could be exploded.      Havana is in a state of tremendous but suppressed excitement. War with the United States is regarded as certain. It has been expected at the Palace for a week, as has been cabled to The World.      The steamer Mascotte was crowded Saturday with refuges of the more timid sort.      English, French and German business houses have cabled 226 their representatives to prepare for war.
