PROJECT ABANDONED BY ORDER OF NAVAL SECRETARY LONG.      (By Cable from a Staff Correspondent of The World.)             (Despatch Passed by Spanish Censor.)            The World, Friday, March 25, 1898, p. 4                                      Havana, Cuba, March 24.      I am able to state definitely that Spain has not yet officially objected to the wreckers using dynamite in removing the Maine’s turret top, so as to secure the big 10-inch guns.      Consul-General Lee has received no information from Captain-General Blanco as to what answer the Government at Madrid has made to Capt. Sigsbee's request.      The project has been temporarily abandoned through direct instructions to Capt. Sigsbee yesterday from Secretary of the Navy Long.      Without the use of dynamite it will be almost impossible to secure the valuable big guns before a rapid submarine growth ruins the bores. 207 OUR OFFICERS IN HAVANA GLAD AT SAMPSON'S CHOICE.                             -----          They Construe It as the President's Advance          Approval of the Work of the Naval Court of              Inquiry into the Loss of the Maine.                             -----      (By Cable from a Staff Correspondent of The World.             Despatch passed by Spanish Censor.)           The World, Friday, March 25, 1898, p. 2                                      Havana, Cuba, March 24.      The American naval officers here are all pleased over Capt. Sampson's reported appointment as fleet commander. It is regarded as signifying the President's approval in advance of the report of the Naval Court of Inquiry.      Although all the officers here except Lieut.-Commander Wainwright have been ordered home by Saturday's steamer, Capt. Sigsbee has asked that Chaplain Chidwick and Surgeon Henneberger be retained in Havana.      Since the new director took hold things have gone with a jump.      For almost the first time in the history of Cuba's customs service a ship-load has been passed before the arrival of the vessel.  This was done for the reconcentrado's food on the Santo Domingo.      To-morrow will be a holiday, but Saturday will see hundreds of tons of food unloaded, and on Sunday it will start in solid train loads over the Cuban railroads for Cuba's hungry ones.      The local press continues to object to American charity, but it suggests no other means of feeding the starving thousands.      Havana's splendid floating dock will now be finally tested, it is reported, by loading it with the big Vizcaya with her bunkers full of coal.  So far the dock has acted very well.  It is a most valuable acquisition for the Spanish Navy.      If Spain had had it sooner more filibustering expeditions would have been caught.  Iron vessels foul very rapidly in these intensely salty tropical waters.      The good Bishop of Havana's blessing of the American Hospital for Children is supplemented by local objections and rumors that the hospital is to be run under Protestant rules, and that children are to be proselyted.
