SPAIN WILL DEMAND INTER-NATIONAL COURT OF INQUIRY.                             -----        Seeking to Gain Time to Avert the Consequences        of the Finding of The United States Board that        the Battle-Ship Was Blown Up from the Outside.                             -----      President McKinley May Oppose the Appointment of an             International Board—All Preparations                    Point to Prompt Action.                             -----     (Special from a World Staff Correspondent, Sent from      Havana to Key West by The World Despatch Steamer.) On Board The World’s Despatch Steamer Confidence, The World, Monday, March 14, 1898, pp. 1, 2                                     Havana Harbor, March 13.      The report of the United States Naval Court of Inquiry upon the cause of the destruction of the Maine will force a demand by Spain for an international investigation.      And from the delicacy of its own position the American court must favor it officially, was welcoming any expert examination of its own findings.      The mass of the testimony sworn to before it has been all one way.  One by one the hypotheses of the most conservative members as to a possible inside initial cause of the explosion have been absolutely refuted by the labors of the intelligent naval divers, and the proofs of their findings have been reasoned out graphically and clearly on paper by expert constructors, also of the navy.      There seems to be no possibility of misconstruing their report, if it is not modified in obedience to hints from Washington.      If that report comes out in full, without modification, it will remain with the American people to say whether any foreign investigator shall decide whether our own investigations are correct, and whether the officers and men of our navy are honest and capable.      The principal Spanish cry from now on will be, “Time; give us time,” just as it has been their war cry for three dragging years of a uselessly destructive Cuban revolution. And they look to our Navy Department for certain compliance.         WORLD’S DISCOVERY VERIFIED BY SPANISH DIVER.      The Spanish divers’ reports verify The World’s 164 announcement that the Maine’s ram has been found much out of line.      Although their superiors’ report, which is prepared already, shows the contrary, the men themselves frankly admit that the Maine’s ram is pointing off to the left of the direction in which the intact rear portion of the ship points.  They indorse The World’s statement that the Maine practically was blown in two, and thus confirm the fact that the ship was demolished by a tremendous explosive force from outside against the port side.      The Spanish divers worked late Friday night about the protruding bottom plates where the bow ought to be.  The day before they reported finding the Maine’s ram on the port side, pointing away from the wreck.  Friday they “thought” they found the bow intact—ram and all—in its proper, relative position.      Their float is now within fifteen yards of the sunken ram.  They may be further examining it.      Their attention was attracted by The World’s soundings, and they descended in the same place a few hours later.  Their report is the result.      Already it is being modified.      The Spanish officers’ official sketch of the divers’ investigations Friday shows the outlined ram in its proper position—exactly contrary to the reports of their own employees.      Our naval experts think the ram lies as I cabled to The World, but that it is possible the Spanish divers have mistaken a portion of the upper part of the boat for the heavy ram.  It has about the same slope and, as stated, probably was blown off to starboard from the solid steel of the ram.  This would place it in about the proper relative position.      I report the findings of these Spanish divers according to what they really discover, and not what their officer’s report.  It is but just, however, to state that they really think to-day that the Maine’s bow is intact and in line.  By to-night they may discover their error.             SUPREME IMPORTANCE OF THIS EVIDENCE.      Much depends on the real position of the ram.  If it is in line with the intact portion of the wreck the theory of an exterior explosion, of course, would not be disproved nor really weakened.  But if it is found out of line then any small boy can know that something must have hit the Maine on her port side and smashed her in two ways from the shock.      Capt. Sigsbee displayed great interest in the report 165 of The World’s “fishing trip” about the forward end of the wreck, and Commander Converse, of the Montgomery, jocularly remarked that next time the small white gig of the Confidence is seen there he will open fire with a one- pounder previously trained on the spot to keep it clear at dinner hours.      The Spanish divers now at work are not naval men but the more experienced hands of the local Harbor Commission, who operate regularly in these foul, obscure waters. They soon found the big forward turret in the mud under the wrecking tug Merritt, where it was hurled away to starboard on the night of the explosion, as The World predicted it would be found. They admit that its top is intact.      This forever does away with the theory that the big magazine exploded, for the turret sat directly over the twenty-five tons of powder, and had that exploded its comparatively thin top would have gone sky high.      The Spanish Inquiry Board expects to take more than a month to finish investigating the wreck.  Its men work about two hours a day, and not hard then.      But the American Court of Inquiry has all the evidence it needs.      The position of the ram was the keystone to the arch of evidence which frames the flaming words, “Mine or Torpedo.”                  THE WORLD HAD ALL THE NEWS.      The highest naval expert here, perhaps, says:  “The World has printed almost all the important proofs discovered.”      The Spanish policy, it is known, will be delay— anything to gain time; to give autonomy and the starving Cuban pacificos longer time to die; to put off the day of national apology and heavy indemnity as long as possible.      The Spanish Government now expects, as I am conservatively informed, to delay the work of its divers and the operations of its own inquiry Board until well into April, and then to bring up points, the answers to which would require further investigation by an American board. The season then would be too unhealthy for our men to work or our ships to stay here longer than a few days at a time.      Then when (as has already been decided by the Spanish Government) the two commissions report diversely, Spain will demand an inter-national board of conservative slowness.      If eventually the verdict would be “an outside cause,” then Spain would pay, after months of postponements and 166 excuses.      All this would take at least six months, and time, time, time is just what Spain has secured for three years of Cuban starvation.      She still wants it—and needs it worse every day.  The insurgents refuse to be seduced by an autonomy so farcical that the majority of its own officers ask for radical changes, and its bitterest opponents, the Volunteers, are being decorated by Spain instead of being disarmed. 167         EXPLOSION OF HATRED EXPECTED IN HAVANA NEXT.                             -----      Government Loosening Its Grip on the Anti-American            Press and Populace Day by Day—The Sight          Of a Few of Our Battle-Ships Would Gladden              the Hearts of Our Citizens in Cuba.                             -----  (Special from a World Staff Correspondent, Sent from Havana     to Key West by The World’s Despatch Boat Confidence.) On Board The World’s Despatch Boat Confidence. The World, Monday, March 14, 1898, p. 2                                     Havana Harbor, March 13.      The feeling here is uneasy.  The air is heavy with vague rumors and every one prays for a quick finish to the American Inquiry Court’s labors.      The anti-American sentiment is growing day by day. Scurrilous pamphlets increase and some really are written by Spaniards.      The censor whom Gen. Blanco keeps to cut just such things out of the local press is unable to prevent veiled threats and abuse of Americans daily in the local columns, though he does cut out reams and reams of highly inflammatory matter.  The censor’s waste basket is jammed full of red-penciled matter written for the Havana press.      Our navy is especially attacked.  Even La Lucha, Havana’s brightest daily, intimates that our ships are poor and our discipline is poorer.      The lower classes thought the little lighthouse tender Fern was a regular battle-ship, and now that the Montgomery is here, they are sure the cruiser must be the biggest fighting vessel left in our fleet.      The suggestion was most timely that the Iowa and the New York should steam into the harbor here for the members of the Board of Inquiry, and then steam right out again.      Of course such ignorant ideas are not shared by the Government, but it would not be Government officials who would kill Americans in a public riot.      The Government is allowing the local press to assume a more belligerent tone daily.      The Correo, a Conservation paper, printed a warning to Spain to be on the alert, as President McKinley was “securing England’s promise of non-interference in America’s Cuban policy.”  Certain war is foreshadowed. 168      This was in connection with a Madrid dispatch which the censor allowed a morning paper to print.  It said that although war seemed improbable, still Spain was fully prepared for it.      Taken together with the recent attacks upon Capt. Sigsbee, the Maine’s officers, the American Navy and Americans in general, these belligerent expressions are very significant.      Spanish business men are much excited over the great drop in Spanish values.  The published statement of the fact is qualified by a claim that the fall was caused by false news from Havana.      The truth is, however, that the local correspondents of the Madrid press are awakening to the facts of the Maine affair and their gravity.      When not abusing everything American the Havana dailies are still explaining that the Maine explosion was “accidental.”  Their theories range from the one generally advanced—that the Maine’s officers were all ashore and that the discipline aboard was indifferent—to the affirmation that the rats got out matches stored in the magazine and that their nibbling detonated the sulphur; then the ship blew up.      The World’s disclosure that the ship was broken in two is publicly acknowledged to be true in the Commercio, a rabid Spanish shopkeepers’ journal.  The report of the Spanish divers secured by The World must have reached it, as such a paper would take no American’s word touching a fact so much against the accident theory.  The article begins:  “But supposing the Maine’s keel is broken,” and then it undertakes to show that an interior explosion did it, although acknowledging that an exploding force surely would take the course of least resistance—which would be upward.      Curiously, every Spanish theory is based upon an explosion of the big 25-ton 10-inch magazine.  Even the Havana editors see that nothing else aboard the ship could have so eaten her up.      But the same men refuse to listen to the number of filled powder cases found, even though, as The World has shown in photographs, their own divers have discovered, raised and examined just such final proofs of the big magazine’s integrity.      While working on the ruins of the superstructure of the Maine, a large part of which still lies under the sluggish waters of Havana harbor, Diver Olsen found an unrecognizable mass of flesh, attached to which was a small 169 patch of hair.  It was the head of one of the Maine’s sailors.  The body to which this head belonged probably was blown to atoms. A large case of surgical instruments belonging to Surgeon Henneberger, of the Maine, was found on the hills of Cabanas, half a mile from the wreck. A small looking glass was the only thing in it that was broken. The case was found by a woman who sold it to another person for $3, from whom it was secured by Dr. Henneberger. The case is worth more than $100.      The members of the American Court of Inquiry are indignant at the anonymous interviews ascribed to them constantly printed by the daily newspapers.  They say the interviews mostly originate in the brains of irresponsible reporters. SICKENED BY HORRORS, CONSUL BARKER RESIGNED.       (Special from a World Staff Correspondent.  Sent            from Havana to Key West by The World's                 Despatch Steamer Confidence.) On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Confidence. The World, Monday, March 14, 1898, p. 3                                     Havana Harbor, March 13.      “I do not propose longer to be a party to a useless sacrifice of lives.”      That is what Walter B. Barker, the United States Consul at Sagua in Grande, wrote Jan 2, and it is the ground upon which he lately sent his resignation to Washington.      The date of the letter, as well as the tone of it, proves that he did not resign on account of any friction with Gen. Lee, as has been reported, over the distribution of relief supplies.      Sagua is a hotbed of ultra Spaniards.  Thousands of Cubans have starved to death there without a helping hand from a Spanish merchant.  Even the American Government relief for its destitute citizens only came in pitiable driblets.      Mr. Barker has seen nothing but Cuban misery and Spanish hatred, and he is sick of it.  Like a brave man, he says so and acts so.      Here is a sample of Spanish generosity in Sagua which I can vouch for:      With the reconcentrados dying like rats, some Cuban women directing a children's dispensary asked ex-Mayor Noneigo, a lawyer named Badia and a merchant named Garcia for donations.  These men had never given anything, and just before that had drawn more than $1,000 in gold in a lottery prize.  Between the three they contributed about $3 worth of condensed milk.      The same ladies asked Senor Tonilla, the Mayor of Santander, Spain, and his brother-in-law for contributions. Both men were fresh from Spain and had come to Cuba to look after the sugar estates their Cuban wives had brought them as dowries.  Each gave $1.26.      I have quoted these two true incidents to show what goes on in every town in Cuba, and why Cuba is already half depopulated by hunger, not by war. 173 Starving Cuba is a blot upon civilization.  May the two hundred and sixty American sailor martyrs dead in Cuban soil so fire the American mind upon this cold fact that the American people shall feel its horrors and its shame, and shall rise in their might and say, “Let there be no more of it!”
