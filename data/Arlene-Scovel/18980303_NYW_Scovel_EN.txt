Lee denies the report that he has been requested to appear in Washington or that any such thing has been even intimated.      He says so far as he knows he is here to stay and to do his best.  He has no idea of returning.      Senator Proctor and Col. Parker made a trip to Matanzas and back to-day.      In going they noticed that the telegraph wires were cut for some distance about ten miles from Havana.  Spanish cavalry had been reconnoitering the fields, and some of the Spanish wounded were brought back to Havana on their train.      When the cruiser Almirante Oquendo arrives there will                              124 be a great festival in honor of two of Spain’s finest ships.      The actual program will not be announced until then, but it is known that there will be a grand dinner and a reception by Gen. Blanco to the ship’s officers and to important personages.      Then there will be a great gala feast in a theatre. There a subscription will be started through which it is expected to raise a large sum of money for new ships for the Spanish Navy.      A grand ball will be given at the Spanish Casino.      No anti-American demonstration is expected in Havana at this time.      The Volunteers met to-day at the Military Club to protest against an article in the Autonomist organ Cuba about disarming them.  A committee waited upon Gen. Parrado and asked him what it meant.  He returned the following answer: “To His Excellency, the Court of Diana:      “I can assure you that the Government has never thought of disarming the Volunteers.”      No Spanish Government would dare carry out such a proposition. No body was recovered to-day from the Maine.      A great effort will be made to-morrow to lift the deck up bodily by means of the powerful wrecking cranes so that the divers can do better work.      The Correo of to-night quotes the Madrid Government as saying that if the American and Spanish Courts of Inquiry do not agree in their findings and conclusions a mixed commission of arbitration will be necessary.      This is the Correo’s first mention of the Maine affair. 125           HEROIC FREDERICK C. HOLZER, AS HE NEARED               THE END IN SAN AMBROSIO HOSPITAL                 Thursday, March 3, 1898, p. 2      HAVANA, March 2.—Poor Holzer gave up the fight for life on Saturday last.      He had been dying for days.  The doctors said there was no hope for him, but Sister Wilbur, the English nun, who was nursing him with all her skill, tried to believe that she would save him.      Holzer was accounted the most heroic of the Maine’s crew.  He was a strong swimmer and could have saved himself, but, seeing others struggling in the water, he gave his energies to their aid.      He overexerted himself, and when he got into the vortex of waters close to his sinking ship he could not prevent the suction from drawing him into boiling water from the Maine’s crater.  He was terribly burned—boiled, in fact—and managed by superhuman effort to get away from the awful spot and to keep himself afloat until he was picked up.       Sympathetic persons, hearing of his bravery and of his   patience under suffering, carried flowers, until his cot   was almost covered with them.  He was devoutly religious. 126                      “SEND MAINE AWAY!”              BEGGED A STRANGER AT OUR CONSULATE.                             -----      Every Day for a Week a Mysterious, Elderly Spaniard        Uttered That Warning, but It Was Unheeded, for                     He Was Deemed a Crank                             -----              BIG ARMOR PLATES BENT INWARD LEAVE                NO ROOM FOR DOUBT AS TO CAUSE.                             -----    Court of Inquiry Knows the Truth and Will Report It to           Washington—It Only Remains Now to Find an              Answer to the Question, Who Did It?                             -----           (Special from a World Staff Correspondent,        Sent by Despatch Boat from Havana to Key West.)           The World, Thursday, March 3, 1898, p.2.                 On Board The World Despatch Boat Confidence,                                       Havana, Cuba, March 2.      “Send the Maine away!  For God’s sake send the Maine away!”      That was the solemn earnest warning of an elderly Spaniard who called at the American Consulate General every day for a week before the disaster.      He had been in the habit of visiting the Consulate twice a week for some time, but after the Maine arrived his visits became more frequent.  The week before the explosion he went daily, fairly begging that the American battle-ship be sent away.      The Consulate officials thought he was crazy then; now they are hunting for him, as he has not been seen about the Consulate since the awful catastrophe.      The Naval Board of Inquiry knows the truth about the cause of the Maine’s blowing up—and expects to report it. The court is composed of the most capable men in the American Navy, and they are honest.      Expert divers who are enlisted American sailors have sworn that the ship’s side was smashed in—not out.      She was struck by a torpedo or a mine under the bottom at the left side.      Even the lower part of the heavy armor belt is bent in. 127      The greatest bending-in of the massive plates was opposite from No. 73, just about across from the big ten- inch magazine, which every one now knows did not explode.      There is no room now for doubt that somebody blew up the Maine and killed 253 sleeping American sailors.      One by one the somber facts in iron, in human flesh and in expert testimony have piled up, all in one direction until there is no room for doubt.      The inward twisted plates and bended armor simply drive the convincing nail through all the hundred-odd bits of material evidence and clinch it.      Abraham Lincoln’s “plain people of the United States” may not quite see the value as proof of a loaded ten-inch powder case recovered from a magazine reported to have exploded.  They might still halt in forcing the President into action for reparation, even after knowing that every movable twisted-off thing on the Maine wreck went toward instead of away from the only interior explosive force big enough to destroy the Maine as she has been destroyed.      But when they now know that the massive plates— splendid steel—have been forced and twisted and bent toward and into the very centre of the ship, they know the Maine was struck from the outside.      Upon the mere intelligent inspection of the pitiable wreck above water the spectator fairly shouts, “Outside force.”      When divers report the peculiar direction of the explosive force in the ship’s inside, conviction grows stronger.      And when, finally, immense, irrefutable physical evidence comes to light of a tremendous blow at a certain point, the proper cause of all other noted effects, conviction becomes fixed.      And when they know that all such tremendous forcing inward was done under water they know that somebody did it.      What did it—torpedo or mine?      Who did it?      The World has asked that question before.  It is employing every endeavor to answer it.      No one charges the Spanish Government with being the direct instigator, but speculation ranges from high army and navy officials who wished the overthrow of Gen. Blanco and an American war at the same time, to subordinate clerks, whose patriotism had grown into a disease by America’s indirect but exasperating intervention in Cuban affairs.      A mine-exploding key might have been mistaken for a 128 testing key, or brandy might have made such an error semi- intentional.      It is now admitted that it is not even remotely likely that Cubans were engaged in the atrocity.  They have not the incentive, nor the money, nor yet the immensely powerful exploding force which certainly was employed.  No small torpedo, even aided by a ton of saluting-powder in the reserve magazine, reduced the Maine to its present condition.  Indeed, of hundreds of rumors, with persons willing to swear to them, only one by any possibility implicated the Cubans.      Although one New York daily makes a great sensation over this on pure hearsay, a careful investigation, aided by the original documents in the case—which were in The World’s possession before even the Board of Inquiry heard any witnesses—indicates that there is nothing in it but talk.      Among the many stories of heroism which are being told of the Maine’s men this is the latest:      A marine sentry on the poop had a hundred cartridges in his belt, but had orders not to load his rifle unless commanded.  When the awful roar of the explosion came he loaded his rifle, then asked for orders.  He thought the Maine was attacked.      Another splendid soldier, Marine Officer Catlin, has that rifle and prizes it.      The Fern though better than she looks and splendidly officered, is not a good American man-of-war for Havana Harbor in these times.  Her one little six-pounder does not look formidable.  She seems in fact a fit companion in helplessness of the sunken Maine.      When the grossly ignorant lower classes judge America’s naval force by the samples sent here in the present trouble, their contempt is aroused.      The populace here hates Americans.  It is made up of people who are densely ignorant, intensely prejudiced and swayed by the naval contrast now shown in the bay by the Vizcaya, and which contrast will be heightened when the Spanish warship Almirante Oquendo arrives.  Then these people may be expected to do damage.      The big black massive Spanish cruiser Vizcaya set Havana wild by her arrival.  For two hours before she got in, from the time of her first telescopic signalling, spurts of detonating rockets flew from the water front. When her black snout poked about the base of gloomy Morro the volley became a battle crash of guns.      Small boats carpeted the harbor, launches flew and big 129 ferry-boats jammed with people and military bands ploughed through the small fry.  Fireworks came from the hundreds of boats until the bay seemed a sheet of fire.        It was just dusk when the big cruiser moored and her    searchlights played over the mass of boats crammed with cheering Spaniards.  It was their day.  The docks and quays                    for miles were packed.
