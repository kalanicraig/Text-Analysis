    
    AMERICAN COLONY 
        WILD WITH FRIGHT

Goverment Vessels Ordered 
    to Havana to Bear Away 
        the Timid Ones.

AND MORE MAY BE NEEDED.

Gen. Lee Authorized to Embargo 
    Any Merchant Vessels in Port 
        for the Service.

LOCAL PRESS MORE BITTER.

A Spanish Order Believed to Be
Especially Aimed at the World's 
Dispatch Boat. 

    Sent from Havana to Key West by The
    World's Despatch Steamer"

On Board The World's Despatch 
Steamer Triton. 

    Havana Harbor, April 4. 
    The coast survey steamer Bache and 
the revenue cutter Black, ordered here,
will arrive to-morrow. They were asked
for by Gen. Lee to satisfy hundreds of 
American citizens and others wishing 
to leave immediately. 
    The American colony is actually 
delirious with fright, Dr. Brunner still
enforces the vaccination.
He has received notice from 
Surgeon-General Wyman only as to yellow fever 
quarantine, raising it until further 
orders. Gen. Lee's advice was that the 
small-pox regulations be nullified also. 
    If to-night's news is not reassuring 
there is very apt to be a small-sized 
American citizen riot in the health officer's 
quarters to-morrow as cabled. It 
was almost that to-day. It is 
understood that the State Department 
instructed Gen. Lee to embargo
the merchant vessels in port if the Blake 
and Bache are insufficient. Gen. Lee is 
thought to be of the opinion, and to have so cabled,
that the regular Plant Line
Steamer Olivette and the Coast
Line passenger steamship would be
much better. The fact is there are no
American merchant vessels here for 
Gen. Lee to levy upon. The little Fern
flies the only American flag here. The
Fern is kept here to transport Gen. Lee
if it becomes necessary.
    The local press grows more bitter in
denouncing sensational American 
journalism in one column and printing 
the most astounding jingo things in 
another. For instance, La Lucha,
Havan's best and really her only 
newspaper, professes to describe the 
true rottenness of the American Navy, 
and after stating that the Indiana,
Oregon and Massachusetts cannot carry
each its own full load, four hundred tons 
coal, without sinking their armor belt 
under water says
    "Overloaded with armament, they are 
good for nothing but patrol boats, in 
spite of their pompous names of
battle-ships." 
    No mention is made of the 13-inch guns 
these ships carry. From this a 
good insight may be gained of Spanish 
ideas as to the American Navy. 
    If Gen. Lee's advice is promptly 
followed and fully Tuesday, Wednesday 
and Thursday will see the Florida, the 
Mascotte and the Olivette, in order
named, transporting frightened men,
women and children, and the little Fern 
will wait for the Consul-General. 
    El Correo to-night says it is assured
"by superior order that all kinds of 
small boats have been prohibited from
approaching the small steamships or 
tugs which these days run between Key
West and our harbor. Only the
authorities of the Navy Health Department
and the police will have to access to these 
boats, which with so much enthusiasm and love,
visit our bay."
    Consul-General Lee thinks that this 
announcement must be unauthorized. 
    The World dispatch boat which makes 
daily trips between Key West and 
Havana, seems to be specifically aimed at.
