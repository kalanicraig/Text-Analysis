Feb. 20.ÑThe divers made only three descents to-day at the wreck of the battleship Maine.      Capt. Sigsbee's state documents were rescued from a private drawer in his cabin.      The keys to the magazines were found just above the hook over the head of the Captain's bed--their usual place. They had been floated upward by the rising of the mattress.      The World first announced that the keys were in their proper place, having been put there at 8 o'clock last Tuesday evening                    CIPHER CODE BOOK FOUND.      The naval cipher code book was found undamaged.  It can be used in messages between Consul-General Lee and the Navy Department and in deciphering the instructions which it is expected are coming on the Fern.      Capt. Sigsbee's watch--which has been wrecked twice before--was also brought up.  It was in a private drawer with the state papers.      Only one body was recovered to-day.  It was not the body of either Lieut. Jenkins or Ensign Merritt.                 ONE HUNDRED YET IN THE WRECK.      About one hundred of the Maine's heroes are yet in the wreck.      Capt. Sigsbee is acting under the orders of Naval Secretary Long.  The Captain wants to save the bodies before proceeding with the investigation into the cause of the disaster, but he does not know what the Secretary's desire is in that respect. 70 Another air-pump has been sent for.      The World renewed its offer of a competent, experienced diving gang accustomed to the black waters of Havana's harbor.  This was done for the sole purpose of saving the remaining bodies.      But Capt. Sigsbee refused the offer, saying that it was a matter for the Navy Department, as it is in charge of the investigation.      Capt. Sigsbee visited to-day the eight maimed sailors in San Ambrosio Hospital.  They were glad.  They had asked after him day by day, while he was being questioned from Washington and here in regard to the Maine's awful end.      The men were all delighted to see their commander. All are doing well, except Koehler and Holtzer.                     A MARTYR'S FORTITUDE.      The latter, as noble as ever man was, is burned, bruised, fractured and internally injured, but his brain is perfectly clear.  He has been in awful pain, and what think you he said when seeing his Captain?      ÒCan't shake hands with you, Captain,Ó he exclaimed, Òbut I am sorry you have lost your ship and your comrades.Ó      This man was dying, mind you!      Capt. Sigsbee was touched deeply.  On parting Holtzer said:      "Come again, Captain.  I wish you better luck next time.Ó      This man was not a servant nor a pet; he was just a plain Maine sailor and was suffering.  He thinks he will recover, but he is literally burned, smashed and torn.      Capt. Sigsbee keeps recurring to these men's talk.  It was wondrously pathetic.  I felt my eyes fill and was not ashamed of it.      The men had no complaint to make.  They highly praise Sister Wilberforce.      But they should be moved to Buenos Aires.
