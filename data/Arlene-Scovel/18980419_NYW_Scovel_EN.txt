A big breaker threw him upon the sharp coral within one hundred yards of the 29-inch gun muzzles. Morro Castle’s eighteen mile sea light threw beams upon him.  He was within Havana’s inner guard lines and within her most jealously guarded fortifications.      To reach the city proper, after inspecting what new teeth Spain’s dogs of war may have, this daring young Government scout and World courier had to keep back from the beach between two doubly-guarded forts up the hill to the edge of Cabanas Fortress Prison, a mile distant.  His situation was then no less perilous.  Two sentry lines must be passed and then some boatman found gritty enough to row an unknown man across patrolled Havana harbor and smuggle him upon some dock.  Then, the watchman evaded, the streets of Havana are gained.                    DANGERS HE HAD TO FACE.      This World correspondent on his mission had first to risk capture by the Spanish coast patrol boat, then by the infantry coast patrol, then by the sentries of four forts, then by two guard lines, then by harbor police, and finally by customs guards, before he could breathe safely.      He did it.  He examined the new fortifications and he arrived safely in Havana.  The next morning at daybreak he crawled, walked and ran over the three miles of picket- covered country and overhauled the batteries in five hours' tremendous patriotic work.  His name must for the present be George Heilberg.      Note the great odds faced as he landed, then consider that the man was that moment dizzy and faint from seasickness, and you can perhaps appreciate what Heilberg did last Saturday night, and what nerve it took to do it. 249             DANGEROUS LANDING FROM THE WORLD TUG.      The landing of Heilberg was made from The World tug Triton.  The Triton ran blind.  There wasn’t a glimmer of light except as the boilers were stoked.  The heat was too severe to completely close the fire-room.  Three miles out of Havana the big tug was slowed down and her surfboat got overboard by Mate Benjamin and his volunteer crew.      When the land loomed black between the twinkling little village of Gojimar on one side and Morro light on the other, the tug stopped.  The towing boat was hauled alongside and crew, passenger and coxswain jumped in as quietly as possible.  There was a keg of water and a basket of provisions to provide for emergencies should a Spanish gunboat chase The World steamer away.      Not five minutes' fast rowing brought the white of the breakers looming through the night.  At once Mate Benjamin took charge.  The boat’s head was thrown to the rollers, and stern was drifted toward the foaming beach. It was “give way” as each big white horse came racing in, and “back her” between them.      At last the shore wasn’t over fifteen yards away. Benjamin jumped overboard after sounding.  The water was up to his waist or over his head, as he was upon a rock or off it, but he took slender Heilberg on his shoulders and dashed for shore.  A racer caught them.  Heilberg was hurled clear upon the coral platform of a beach and Benjamin was cut against it.  But they had made the landing.      Benjamin struggled to the boat.  We hauled him aboard, and with a good, strong good-by to drenched, nauseated, but plucky Heilberg, we started for the Triton, the mate at the helm and the rest of us pulling the four oars.  Alongside, all hands swarmed up her sides.  The falls were made fast, the boat hauled up by the rim and the “jingle bell” started the smart tug Triton seaward at full speed.                   INSPECTION OF THE COAST.      The landing had taken only forty minutes, and they had been tense ones.      Next morning at 7 o’clock began a more exciting service.  We started at Matanzas, fifty miles east of Havana, and steamed westward at full speed close ashore, noting the coast line.  Each sandy beach, each gap between the coast hills, each cleared ascent itself practicably for infantry, cavalry, artillery, or all three together, were careful noted.      Knowing the speed of the Triton and of the opposing Gulf Stream, approximate distances were noted.  Afterward 250 these have been rectified by naval charts, and to-day Commander-in-Chief Sampson has detailed knowledge of the best landing places and the worst ones from Matanzas to Mariel, a distance of seventy miles.  He knows the landmarks for day and those for night approach to each from Matanzas to Havana, and the trip excited no shore attention.  Vessels bound for Savannah often hug the coast to avoid the strong Gulf current.  But when the little Triton shot by Havana Harbor’s narrow neck instead of entering, when she hoisted no flag, then black specks dotted Morro Castle and a new filibuster must have been reported.      To allay suspicion Capt. Chase hauled out a bit to sea as if bound for Tortugas, until directly north from Mariel. Then with wheel hard-a-port the Triton spun around on her keel and back we flew, almost touching the shore, toward Havana again, but out of sight from Morro’s observatory.      The Gulf current with her, the big tug stepped lively, and The World staff was kept busy noting the coral coast and sand beach and buoys and coast hills and good camping localities and little Spanish forts.      We were close, so close that the Spanish garrisons tumbled out.  Buglers shrilled “to arms” and captains waved swords.  But nobody pulled trigger.      Back toward Havana we steamed.  One pair of binoculars was constantly on Morro, looking for a speeding white object and pouring black smoke which would mean an investigating Spanish cruiser or gunboat.  None came.      We kept on until right abreast of Vedado, Havana’s swell suburb, and within range of Santa Clara’s six- pounders the Triton hauled up north by east and the trip began across the Gulf for Key West, rest and report.                   FLEET COMMANDER PLEASED.      Commander-in-Chief Sampson and Chief-of-Staff Chidwick both expressed themselves in behalf of the Government greatly pleased with The World’s detailed information, and congratulated the officers and men of the Triton for their behavior.
