HEROIC MARINES SLEEPING IN                    TRENCHES ON THEIR ARMS.                             -----             (Special Cable Despatch to The World)                Wednesday, June 15, 1898, p.2.      ON BOARD THE WORLD DESPATCH BOAT TRITON, OFF GUANTANAMO, Monday, June 13, via Port Antonio, Jamaica, Tuesday, June 14.—      After three sleepless, anxious nights and days, being bushwhacked from the densest undergrowth, the First Marine Battalion is stretched in groups in the stupor of weariness under bushes, blankets, boards—anything for shade.      A few sappers are completing the intrenchments, which were not begun until after the men had passed two nights undefended on an exposed hill.      The men acted bravely and cannot be too highly praised.      A parrallelogram has been laid out on a small plateau, with shallow trenches, the dirt banked outward and patched with lumber and barrels.  Field pieces are at the corners facing the land approaches.  Two Colt automatics are at the sides.  Lee rifles are stacked in two lines.  The colors are flying from the top of the foundation of the burned Spanish blockhouse.  Tired men are everywhere.      The officers now realize what the Cuban manigua is.      To-night (Monday) no close attack is expected.      Perez’s Cubans, well armed with navy rifles, have arrived.  They will take the guard, supported by three platoons of marines.      The line will be thrown well out toward the Spanish position at a well.  This our men expect to take to-morrow morning destroying the Spanish water supply and rendering further annoyance in small numbers unlikely.      The marines long for Maxim guns.  Their two Colts broke down.  They are now being repaired.      Lieut.-Col. Huntington’s position is backed by the Dolphin and Marblehead.  It is practically impregnable.  No attempts to burn the undergrowth have succeeded so far.      The cable-ship Adria has grappled the end of the French cable.  Instruments are expected Wednesday, when the line will be opened.
