FIRST DAY’S FIGHTING RESULTED                   IN VICTORY FOR AMERICANS.                             -----   (Special Cable Despatch from one of The World’s Staff of               War Correspondents at the Front.)             The World, Sunday, July 3, 1898, p. 2      PLAYA DEL ESTE, July 1.—After a day of fierce fighting, in which Shafter’s army made a series of desperate assaults upon the Spanish outposts, from Aguadores, on the coast, to and beyond El Caney, four miles inland, the American troops have carried everything before them, are within a mile of the city of Santiago, and the final attack upon that city is only a question of a few hours.      The victory has been a grand one, but it has cost dearly in the killing and wounding of men on both sides. So far as the fighting before El Caney is concerned, the heavy loss on the American side was largely due to the mistake of massing infantry behind the position taken by the battery.      The attack on El Caney was made by the Second Division, under Gen. Lawton.  Last night his 5,000 men bivouacked without fires close to the Spanish lines.  The break of day found the army ready for action.      Gen. “Joe” Wheeler’s cavalry corps took the centre of the line before San Juan.  The General was so sick that he put Gen. Summer in command, but as soon as the fighting began “Fighting Joe” insisted on being carried upon the field on a litter, borne on the shoulders of four of his men.  Thus he watched and directed the movements of his troops.      In a slight valley near by Grimes’s battery of four guns took position.  The Second Artillery was placed on a hill at El Pozo Ranch, somewhat more than a mile and a half from the first defenses of Santiago City.  Capt. Capron’s battery was placed on an elevation about the same distance from El Caney.      Gen. Duffield’s brigade advanced along a ridge to make a feint, while the brigades under Gens. Chaffee, Ludlow and Miller supported the advance of Lawton’s troops.  Gen. Pearson’s brigade took a position in the rear of Gen. Wheeler’s cavalry and waited for orders.      The day was clear and the sun scorchingly hot, but a cooling sea breeze made the conditions a little more bearable for the Americans. 329      Before 7 A. M. the fighting was opened by the booming of a gun from Capt. Capron’s battery, fired at the Spanish block-house, in which a battery was strongly fortified. There was a cheer from Capron’s men when they saw that they had the range, for the Captain is the father of young Capt. Capron of Roosevelt’s Rough Riders, who was killed at Sevilla, and they wanted to avenge his death.      Without delay the Spanish guns began to answer from the forts and trenches.  Grimes’s battery soon joined in the cannonading, directing its fire upon the Spanish works on the side of the hill at San Juan and working its shot toward the block-house, from which the enemy were delivering a terrific fire.      The firing on both sides was very accurate.  The shells burst like clockwork.  The Spanish gunners had a great advantage in that our forces were using common powder, the smoke of which enabled the Spanish gunners to get a perfect range.  Our gunners could only approximate the positions of the Spanish guns, as they were using smokeless powder.  Yet their firing was remarkably accurate.      Our batteries fired one hundred rounds each, about two-thirds shell and the rest shrapnel.  Within an hour the Spanish fire began to be less regular and before 9 A. M. it had ceased altogether.      Just prior to that hour Wheeler’s cavalry had been ordered to advance, but scarcely had the order to march been given when they were brought to a halt by information that the Spaniards were in retreat toward Santiago.      During the fight the First and Tenth companies of Roosevelt’s Rough Riders were stationed along the hillside in the bushes.  They were in the line of the fire from the Spanish batteries at San Juan, which were using shrapnel almost exclusively, yet the men kept cool and actually joked and laughed as they speculated on their chances of escaping injury.  Several of them were wounded.      The balloons of the Signal Corps were doing splendid work securing accurate information concerning the exact location of the enemy and the character of their defenses. One sent out yesterday floated just over the tree tops and was easily guided for three miles along the road toward the enemy’s lines.  It halted to take photographs, and the Spanish sharpshooters tried their best to bring it down with their guns.      Battery A of the Second Artillery deserves no little credit for the work it did against the El Caney batteries, particularly as they had to fight an enemy using smokeless 330 powder, while they were using the common article.  For about three hours they were engaged in hot fighting.      This battery was supported by about 200 Cubans, with a Hotchkiss gun.  The Cuban leader Gonzales reports that about twenty of the Cubans were killed or wounded.      At the end of three hours there was no return firing from El Caney and only scattering shots came from San Juan.      All morning the wounded have been limping and crawling to the rear or are being brought in on stretchers carried by their comrades.      It has been a procession such as would make strong men shudder.      Yet these heroes bear their wounds and their agony with a silent fortitude that arouses the greatest admiration.  Their patience while waiting for surgical attendance in a heat so intense that fever is sent surging through their veins is simply marvelous.  Groups of the wounded sit wherever they can find a shady spot and do what little they can for each other.  It is heartrending.      So far about one hundred have passed to the rear since the firing began.  Owing to the fact that the road is in the line of fire and packed with soldiers it is impossible to get the ambulance or hospital corps within a mile and half of the front, else much suffering might be relieved. It is a miracle that there are so few casualties along the road.      The courage of our men is superb.  I passed through the ranks of the Seventy-first New York.  The men, waiting orders to advance, with occasional shells bursting over their heads, were in good spirits.  On all sides I heard the men exclaiming, referring to the enemy:      “Oh, if we could only see them and get at them!”      When it was evident that the enemy was breaking all along the line hearty cheering marked the advancement of the American forces. 331 GARCIA SAYS PANDO HAS JOINED                  THE SPANIARDS IN SANTIAGO.                             -----     (Special Cable Despatch from One of The World’s Staff                 Correspondents at the Front.) The World, Sunday, July 3, 1898, p. 4      PLAYA DEL ESTE, Cuba, July 2.—Late last night I had a conversation with Gen. Garcia.  From him I learned that Gen. Pando, who has been hurrying by forced marches from Manzanillo, has succeeded in entering Santiago with 6,000 men.      There was a force of but 800 Cubans to stop his march to the city and they were unable to do so.
