Miles, (Lieut. Whitney, of the Bureau of Military Intelligence), to discuss the basis of the plan of campaign to be adopted against the common enemy.      ÒBut Gen. Miles should know that he need not venture his ships too far in perilous enterprises, for in this, our own ground, we need no more than munitions with which to finish with the Spaniards, as the Island of Cuba is in such a condition that they cannot resist six months of rigorous siege.                                                   ÒM.
