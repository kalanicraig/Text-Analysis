HAVANA GUNNERS COULD NOT HIT ONE OF OUR WARSHIPS.                             -----        Practice of Coast Defense Batteries Showed Such             Lack of Skill that Spanish Spectators                        Were Disgusted.                             -----    (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World.  Sent   from Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer.)         On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Triton,            The World, Tuesday, April 5, 1898, p. 3                                      Havana Harbor, April 4.      Spain has just spent half a day, at least $10,000 and twenty-seven modern properties to show the naval authorities of the United States just how poorly Spanish artillerymen can handle good guns.      Capt. Sampson, of the Key West fleet, is now in possession of the results.      Everything was favorable.  Wind, weather and water were easy, and the artillerymen were not being shot at. They had plenty of time to leisurely load, [. . .late] and sight.      Their batteries had an exceptionally fine, long base line from Morro Castle to figure angles from.      Yet the four big Krupps and the two bigger Ordones rifles were so bunglingly handled that only two shots fell close enough to the mark to have been even uncomfortably close visitors to an American battle-ship of the largest size.      The following table tells the tale.  It is calm, and cruel and true: No.of shot 1 2 3 4 5 SANTA CLARA BATTERY'S WORK.

Fully five hundred Spaniards watched the practice. After the first shot they ceased cheering.      Before that they had amused themselves making insulting and coarse remarks about the World correspondent and his companions.  Later the full force of the inefficiency of their coast defense penetrated even into their inexpert brains and they kept quiet.      The burden of their early remarks was a vigorously expressed wish that the big guns could only carry as far as Key West.  I felt like saying that if they could and were as badly aimed they would hit Tortugas Island instead, about sixty miles off.      Here is an expert report upon the above results:      ÒAt 4:10, April 4, 1896, the Spanish batteries immediately to the westward of the entrance to Havana Harbor engaged in target practice.  Three batteries were engaged: the mortar battery Reina, the heavy modern battery Santa Clara, and a mortar battery a few hundred yards to the windward of Santa Clara.      ÒThe Reina battery consists of six obsolete muzzle- loading mortars with a bore of eight inches calibre, mounted on old stone forts of little value.  This battery was manned by the volunteer artillerymen of Havana.  Six shots were observed from this battery from a point behind the Santa Clara battery, and all of them fell far short of the target.  The official range as indicated by the figures 229 of the Santa Clara range board was 6,000 metres (about three miles and a quarter).  None of the shots from this battery fell within half a mile of the target. ÒThe Santa Clara battery is the principal defence of the western side of the entrance. It consists of four 11- inch Krupp guns, two 12 1/2-inch guns and two mortars estimated at 3 inches.                    MISERABLE MARKSMANSHIP.      "The practice of this battery was decidedly poor.  Out of thirteen shots observed, one struck the water at about 500 yards from the battery, another struck the water a full mile to the left of the target.  Nine were from 100 to 500 yards out of line, as observed from directly behind the battery.      ÒWhile the error in range could not be determined, it is more than probable that these shots were not within 500 yards of the target.  One shot was a line shot, but was observed to fall short, and one was observed to fall about 90 feet to the right and with good range as far as could be determined from my position.      ÒIt is scarcely probable that more than one shot from this battery would have struck a target the size of one of our battleships at anchor.  The ranges changed very slowly. The targets were not anchored, but drifted to the eastward at the rate of about one mile per hour.      ÒThe practice from the mortar battery to the westward of Santa Clara was exceptionally poor.  Out of twelve observed shots from this battery only one struck in the vicinity of the target, and the other eleven did not strike within 700 yards at the very least estimate.      ÒThe fire was slow.  The shortest interval between shots of the Santa Clara battery was two minutes, but no two consecutive shots were from the same gun.  It is not known whether the batteries fired with the greatest speed consistent with accuracy.      ÒThe time of flight of the heavy rifles' projectiles was 14 seconds, and the mortar projectiles 23 seconds.      ÒThe target practice was conducted under the most favorable circumstances.  The sun was behind and to the left of the batteries and the sea was smooth.  A gentle breeze was blowing across the line of fire at an angle of 60 degrees.  The practice was in no way obstructed by smoke.      ÒAs a whole the shooting was poor.Ó               WAS BELOW AMERICAN REQUIREMENTS.      To realize how poor, it should be understood that in the United States naval practice an error to right or left 230 of 75 feet at this range scores zero.  In general, the gunner who doesn't always make a line shot is severely censured.  These standards obtain when the shooting is from a rolling ship.  The Spaniards shot from the solid, immovable earth.      Capt. Sampson need have no fear in bombarding Havana. There are only two big guns here which we did not see in actual operation.  They form one-third of the new batteries in construction of the other side of Morro Castle.      Even had our biggest battle-ship been at anchor only two shots were close enough to be uncomfortable, yet the Havana papers, with the fatuous self-deceit Spain always has had and will have, proudly print that ÒAll the officers were delighted with magnificent results obtained.Ó      All the guns save the odd-line mortars were manned by regular artillerymen.
