CONGRESS TO VOTE A WAR FUND OF FIFTY MILLIONS        NAVAL BOARD OF INQUIRY TO FINISH IN THREE DAYS.                             -----      Naval Board Report Will Reach Washington Next Week,         It is Now Believed, and It Will Be Unanimous                   as to Cause of Explosion.                             -----      PRESIDENT HAS OPTIONS ON CRUISERS BUILT FOR JAPAN.                             -----              One by the Cramps in Philadelphia,                  the Other in San Francisco;          Both Can Be Got in Three Months—More Large                     Torpedo Boats Wanted.                             -----         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)            The World, Tuesday, March 8, 1898, p. 1                               HAVANA, Cuba, March 7, 10 P.M.      The Maine Court of Inquiry will finish its work within three days, I am reliably informed.      The members are satisfied, I am certain, of the cause of the disaster.  All indications still point to a unanimous report, but the Court maintains great reserve.      Capt. Chidwick did not don the diver’s helmet, it now appears, and descend into the Maine’s wrecked interior.  He accepts the divers’ reports as true.      Consul Barker’s resignation asks for its immediate acceptance.  Probably his request will be granted.      Mr. Barker’s inflexibility is well known.      Senator Proctor and Miss Barton are with Mr. Barker now.  They will try to persuade him to stay.  He did noble work.      The city is still full of rumors of the wholesale expulsion of American newspaper men.  Probably there is more smoke than fire, as these men have never blamed the Spanish Government for the Maine disaster.      The latest navy Department news reports that an American schooner has been seized on the south coast on suspicion of being a filibuster.      The big wreckage tug Right Arm left to-day for some unknown destination.  Her captain expects to return soon.
