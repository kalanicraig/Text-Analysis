GEN. LEE LEAVES HAVANA ON THE FERN. -----She Is the Last Vessel to Go—The Consul-General Sees That All Americans Are Safe—Tremendous Welcome Awaits Him.-----(Special Cable Despatch to The World.)            The World, Sunday, April 10, 1898, p. 3 HAVANA, April 9—9:30 P.M.—United States Consul-General Lee and his staff, with Consuls Springer and Barker, left Havana at 6 o’clock to-night on the lighthouse tender Fern.      The wharf was crowded but no discourtesy was shown.      The American flag flies no longer in Havana.  It disappeared at 8 o’clock as the Fern’s flagstaff turned round Morro.      The Evelyn led the way.  The Olivette followed and the Bache and Fern closed the line carrying Lee, the Consulate staff and the American correspondents.  Far off in the horizon three American warships awaited the American refugee flotilla.  Lee goes away sorry he was unable to see Blanco, who was ill when Lee called at the palace.      Gollan, who will have charge of the American Consulate, is a good friend of Blanco and had a friendly conference with him to-day. At 2:30 o’clock to-day Gen. Lee boarded the Fern.      At noon he lunched with Capt. Cowles and it is yet generally thought he is in the consulate, where Vice-Consul Springer is just finishing the issue of some tickets to refugees.      There has been not one anti-American demonstration, and street discipline is as fine as in London.      No increase of the police force is evident.      The high wind blowing in the harbor makes difficult the work of embarkation in small sailboats, and all steam launches are taxed to their utmost capacity. Ensign Powelson has just finished his visits of official courtesy ashore and to the Alfonso XII., on behalf of the Fern’s commander.      Gen. Lee has ordered all American ships out of the harbor as quickly as possible.  The Fern will leave last.      The British Consul, Gallon, is on the point of sealing the effects of the United States Consulate although Springer may stay over to-morrow to despatch the remainder. He wishes to take the Seneca, due to-morrow for New York, direct. One American schooner is now getting under 241 way.      The local press counsels moderation by order of Gen. Blanco.      Censor Mendez ruthlessly red pencils all hostile articles.      By 6 o’clock the red, white and blue will disappear from Havana Harbor.      At 9 o’clock this morning all American citizens who had money to purchase tickets began to crowd the Consulate and the Plant line ticket office.      It was the evacuation day of the American colony, and promised to be a big affair.      Nothing being done at Sagua to care for American citizens.      Consul Barker says he had neither ship nor money; that even if he had had a steamer, not five families out of the 400 American citizens there have money enough to pay the eleven miles railroad fare to Sagua’s seaport.      Gen. Lee and Mr. Gallon, the British Consul-General, met before noon and arranged the transfer of the American consulate to England’s care.      The two Consul-Generals then went to the palace to bid official farewell to Gen. Blanco and pay their respects.      At noon the signal was given and soon hundreds of boats were dotting the harbor between the shore and the little refuge fleet, and the American exodus begun.      At 5:30 the American vessels began leaving port.  The Spanish tug Susie towed out the schooner James H. Dudly, which arrived here on Thursday last from Pensacola with lumber, but did not discharge her cargo.      The steamer Evelyn followed with about fifty passengers and after her came the Olivette, with 247 passengers, among whom were Miss Clara Barton and the other representatives of the Red Cross Society who have been engaged in relief work in the island. She was followed by the Bache, with ten passengers, and last of all came the Fern, which left at six o’clock, having on board Consul-General Lee, Consuls Johnstone, Peiper, Redding, Akers, Franke, Dunning, Nichols and Scovel: Messrs. G. Lawton Childs and William Lawton and Dr. Brumer.      The Fern is commanded by Lieut-Commander Cowles.      Ensign Powelson was also on board.      There was shipped to-day by the steamer Orizaba $424,000 in French gold for New York.  El Correo asserts that sixteen electors from the suburb Chaves who voted at the last election left to-day, having been supplied with 242 passports as American citizens.
