BATTLE-SHIP TEXAS DESTROYED                      THE SOCAPA BATTERY.                             -----  (Special Cable Despatch from a World Staff Correspondent.)                The World, June 24, 1898, p. 2      OFF SANTIAGO, Cuba, June 22, via Port Antonio, Jamaica, June 23.—While Gen. Shafter’s army of invasion was landing at Daiquiri to-day (Wednesday) the battle-ship Texas made a demonstration at Matamoras, west of Santiago, aided by a Cuban land force of 2,000 men, commanded by Jesus Rabi.      While it failed of Gen. Shafter’s purpose to attract the mass of the Spanish soldiers west of Santiago, it brought about the finest naval incident of the war.      The Texas alone silenced and apparently destroyed, a battery which Schley’s whole division had twice fiercely, but unavailingly, bombarded.      In accomplishing this deed she did not go unscathed. A Spanish shell perforated the battle-ship, killed one of the crew and wounded eight others.      During the battle the great battle-ship went so close to land that she almost touched the shore, taking the Socapa battery on the flank.  One hundred and thirty-five 6-inch and 12-inch shells were fired.      The Spanish forces were driven from the Matamoras field batteries, and the Socapa battery was destroyed.      The aim of the Texas gunners was splendidly accurate. The Vesuvius’s officers were stationed opposite the Texas’s target.  They say hers was the finest marksmanship of the war.      The Admiral is delighted with Capt. Philip.  He told me: “We have destroyed them.”      The Texas is the first American vessel to be perforated in Cuban waters by Spanish shells.  Naval Expert Rea cables a technical description in his official capacity.      The Texas left the fleet at 8.15 A. M. Her object was to shell the blockhouse a quarter of a mile inland at Matamoras.  It had been arranged at Monday’s council of war that Gen. Rabi, with 2,000 Cubans lying in the woods back of Matamoras, should attack the Spaniards occupying the plateau adjoining Santiago.  Fifteen colliers had been made to look like transports, with a view to deceiving the Spaniards into the belief that a landing was to be made at Matamoras or Cabanas, west of Santiago. 317      The Texas passed up to within half range of the western battery and slowly swung around half broadside opposite the narrow entrance of Cabanas Bay.      After a moment a puff of smoke came from her side, and puffs of fire flashed from three of her openings.  Three range shots hurtled through the air.      The battery answered with a single big gun.  But the shell went far above the Texas and dropped into the sea a quarter of a mile beyond her.      The Texas responded with her bow gun.  It was a splendid shot, landing just in front of the battery.      The next shot from the battery struck a quarter mile short of the big battleship, but the next shell from the Texas’s bow gun struck the battery, and the responding shell from the Spaniards dropped within fifty yards of the battle-ship.  The Spaniards were finding the range.      At that moment, 8.30 o’clock, the men on the Texas could discern the advancing front of the Cubans, firing as they advanced.  It was then that the real battle was begun. From the deck of The World despatch boat it was a sight never to be forgotten.      The guns of the secondary battery of Cervera’s ships opened upon the advancing Cubans.  The Spanish shots went characteristically wild.      The cannonading was incessant.  The air was filled with smoke that hung over the water like a white veil, with scarcely a breath of air to dissipate it.      With the boom of each of the Texas’s big guns spouts of water, evidently from inland springs, would shoot high into the air with huge quantities of earth.      Suddenly from the plateau to the left there came a volley of rifle shots fired by the Spaniards.  Mauser bullets pattered about the Texas like hailstones.  About forty volleys were fired in rapid succession.      The Texas then moved to a point within less than 500 yards.  As the big battle-ship began hurling shells into the Spaniards the land batteries returned the compliment with uncomfortable results.  It was then apparently that the battleship was hit.  Several shells struck close to her.      Just then the Texas was lost in a cloud of smoke.  A moment later she opened up with her rapid-fire guns.      The fire had the desired effect.  The Spaniards galloped to a new position along the protected road just over the crest of the hills.      Through a gap in Cabanas bay it could be seen that the Cubans, anticipating the move of the Spaniards, had taken a 318 position so as to engage the enemy at closer quarters.      A quarter of a mile from the Texas a Spanish field battery opened fire on the Cubans from the bushes.  This was the second attack by the field battery.  The firing was from a point 500 yards west of the first position.      The Texas all this time was keeping up an incessant attack with her big guns and rapid-fire battery.  Every shot appeared to go straight to the target and never did American gunners do better work.      At 9.40 o’clock it became evident that the Socapa fortifications had been completely silenced.  Not a shot had been fired from her guns since 9 o’clock.  The other batteries, too, were then badly damaged, only an occasional shot coming from them.      The Texas at 10 o’clock completed her work, with probably tremendous losses to the Spaniards.      At that hour the Spanish and Cuban forces were still fighting.  The Texas drew away. 319         ONLY 200 CUBANS IN THE ATTACK WITH THE TEXAS.                            -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)                The World, June 24, 1898, p. 2      COL. CEBRECO’S CAMP, six miles west of Santiago, Cuba, June 22, via Port Antonio, June 23.—This (Wednesday) morning 200 Cubans under Col. Cebreco, brother of Gen. Cebreco, attacked the Spanish outposts west of Santiago.      Gen. Shafter’s plan contemplated an attack by 2,000 men.  Had they obeyed, Gen. Shafter’s hope of drawing the Spaniards in force westward while he disembarked to the eastward would have been successful.      But the Spaniards moved in neither direction, staying intrenched at Santiago.      The rifle fire of a handful of Cubans and the presence of two transports and one schooner, with the accustomed bombardment from the sea, was not enough to convince them of an American landing.      The Cubans claim that the non-arrival of promised food prevented them from concentrating 2,000 men.      They claim, however, to have driven 400 Spaniards from Coletta, the most important outpost.      As exclusively cabled to The World, there are five of these outposts on a north and south line running twelve miles inland.  By taking these Gen. Shafter can control the hill nearest to Santiago within half range and upon the flank of the harbor.      The harbor entrance defenses could be completely and cheaply destroyed, allowing Admiral Sampson to drag for torpedoes and capture or destroy the Spanish ships. Incidentally he would have Santiago and the Spanish troops at his mercy. 320          OUR MEN MUST FIGHT ALL THE WAY TO SANTIAGO.                             -----     (Special Cable Despatch from a Staff Correspondent.)            The World, Friday, June 24, 1898, p. 2      BIVOUAC OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY AT DAIQUIRI, Cuba, June 22, via Port Antonio, Jamaica, June 23.—At 10 to-night (Wednesday) the engineers have finished repairing the dilapidated pier.  Huge barges of supplies have been rolled over its iron track and piled symmetrically about a villainous-looking dynamite gun.  Working parties with lanterns are picking their way toward bivouacs where a thousand fires are flickering, and the first day of the first debarkation of American troops in force in Cuba is most luckily ended.      Gen. Linares ignored this morning’s firing both east and west, and the little Spanish guard of fifty men placed over the iron company’s property—less than one to each American ship here—not being reinforced, retreated without effective shooting.      The formidable hills were occupied.  The blockhouse is empty, but there are fifteen miles of mountain road to Santiago, meaning almost inevitable heavy bushwhacking over each spur and each hill.      The coast path it is possible to protect from the sea, but it is almost impracticable.  The only other fair road is the Sevilla road, running inland and winding about a most broken country.      The march to Santiago is a serious affair, especially as Gen. Shafter hasn’t mule batteries to take through the bush and shell bushwhacking bodies.  This lack is most seriously felt and cannot soon be remedied.      The soldiers are in fine form.  The miraculously easy landing is joked about at every little bivouac fire.  The ground is sandy, the night dry, and the men in dog tents and comfortable.  Groups and squads are still searching the houses and smoldering beams of the iron company’s machine shops for relics.  I even saw foragers, two privates, each with a bunch of chickens.      The Cubans are extremely happy, despite the loss of a man’s arm.  Gen. Castillo’s party was mistaken for Spaniards and twenty shells were fired before the Cuban flag was recognized.  The nearest and largest Spanish force is at Siboney, six miles west.  Five hundred are entrenched there.  North are 200 Cuban scouts.  No news has yet been received of a Spanish advance from Santiago and nothing 321 except a slight skirmish is possible to-morrow.
