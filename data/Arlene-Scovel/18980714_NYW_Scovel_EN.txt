            GEN. KENT, THE SAN JUAN HERO, THANKS              THE WORLD FOR ITS CONGRATULATIONS.            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)  Gen. Shafter’s Headquarters, in front of Santiago, July 12,                  via Port Antonio, July 13.           The World, Thursday, July 14, 1898, p. 1      Gen. Kent, the real hero in the capture of San Juan, cables The World the thanks of himself and his division for its congratulations upon his brilliant achievement.      He says the splendid discipline of his men told in the critical work, and that they are now standing the strain well. 337                 TORAL DIPLOMATICALLY REFUSES                 TO SURRENDER, BUT GAINS TIME.            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)         The World, Thursday, July 14, 1898, pp. 1, 2      GEN. SHAFTER’S HEADQUARTERS, near Santiago, July 12, via Port Antonio, July 13.—Gen. Toral, in command of the Spanish forces in Santiago, has again declined to surrender to our army unless he is allowed to march his men with arms and equipment to Holguin.  This stipulation is regarded as ridiculous by Shafter, who knows that it would mean a junction with another Spanish force, which would surely serve to prolong the war.      A desultory fire was kept up all yesterday.  Every few minutes shells were tossed into the Spanish trenches.  The greatest damage was inflicted by Hallett Alsop Borrowe’s dynamite gun, worked by a number of Rough Riders.  One shell blew a Spanish gun into fragments and another tore an immense gap in one end of a Spanish trench, causing the Spanish soldiers who were not killed to rush pell-mell out at the other end.      Here they were met by an accurate volley from the men of the Sixteenth Infantry, who had a perfect range on that end of the trench.  The first volley killed and wounded many and drove the others back again into the trench in great disorder.      The field mortars are being tried, but the results are not yet entirely satisfactory, owing to the difficulty of getting a perfect range.      On the whole, yesterday’s offensive operations were weak so far as giving a basis for a new proposition to surrender.      Gen. Toral, with profuse politeness, told Gen. Shafter that surrender under the American conditions was ridiculous.  He reiterated his conditions, as originally stated by him.      The first of the six new field batteries has arrived at the front, and the others are on the way.  Although the rain has ceased, the roads are barely passable.  The new artillery is to be posted north and south in flanking positions.  When they are in position and all of the army is in general action, the American troops will so completely envelop the Spanish positions that a proposition to surrender will in all likelihood come from the Spanish themselves. 338 Should the enemy not surrender drastic measures will be taken.  A general assault, with its certainty of bloodshed is regarded as cheaper for us in the end, owing to the great danger confronting the troops from disease by the delay.      Siboney and Altares are being burned, and this improves the sanitary outlook somewhat.  Had this been done at first the conditions would now be much better.      The burning of the two villages is enlivened by frequent explosions, caused by forgotten ammunition for Mauser rifles left in the houses.      Prominent staff officers attached to Gen. Shafter say that there will be no general attack until all of the new artillery is in position.  This cannot be done within three days at least, owing to the fearful condition of the roads. This would bring the time of the general assault up to Friday.      The siege guns are still hidden away somewhere. Artillery officers concur in the statement that the siege guns ought to be placed in position at once.  The horses of the light batteries could move the siege carriages without fear that the enemy would make sorties to capture the guns during the operation.      The divisions of Gen. Kent and Gen. Henry are now well to the front.  The First Illinois Volunteers broke all records by landing and occupying a position at the front in one day.  The only Ohio regiment here is the Eighth.      A terrific storm raged all last night.  The volunteers stood the terrible discomfort nobly, as did their officers. Every one was soaked through and through.      Col. Wagner has been in conference with Gen. Miles on board the cruiser Yale, reporting to him the conditions at the front.      When the time for the final action comes the Spaniards will be warned to evacuate the nearest hospital barracks, which stand immediately behind the principal trenches.  A slightly overtimed shell would strike the buildings, which are filled with wounded and would give the enemy a much prayed-for chance to criticize our methods of warfare.      Sharp shooting has ceased.  It is now evident it was done chiefly by stragglers.      Men and officers are suffering greatly for a change of clothing.  It is now seventeen days since they have had a change of underclothing.  There is little opportunity for the men to wash or bathe.  The extreme labor they have been forced to do in the tropical sun must have unhealthy results.
