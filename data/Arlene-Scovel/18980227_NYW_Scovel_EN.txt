RIGHT ARM RECOVERING THE DEAD. The World, Sunday, Feb. 27, 1898, p. 2      The crew of the wrecking steamer Right Arm has built a platform on the wreck of the Maine and worked vigorously to-day at saving the bodies of the dead.      Only one body was found with the head on and even that could not be recognized.      I have spent the most of the day alongside the Maine studying the wreck. Two more divers arrived to-day from Florida on the steamship Olivette.      The naval court of inquiry left to-night for Key West.      Seaman Holzer, of New York, died to-day noon in San Ambrosia Hospital. La Lucha prints an open letter which the correspondents of American newspapers sent to the press censor, Senor Mendez, heartily thanking him for his valuable co-operation in sending out by cable their despatches regarding the disaster to the Maine.      The letter was signed by The World correspondent and by the correspondents of all the other New York newspapers represented here and of the Press Association.
