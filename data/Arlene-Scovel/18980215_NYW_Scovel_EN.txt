Sigsbee says were in perfect order.      Capt. Sigsbee, although badly wounded in the face, was very cool giving orders to officers and men.      The officers also showed great coolness and valor giving orders to men.      They were in their shirt-sleeves, having been hurled from their bunks at this moment.      They are bringing the wounded to land.      Some are mortally wounded and will probably die.      Five minutes after the explosion the Spanish warship Alfonso Doce had lowered her boats and was picking up those who were swimming.      United States Consul-General Lee is at the Governor- General’s palace conferring with Captain-General Blanco.
