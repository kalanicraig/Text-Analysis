SAYS HE OVERHEARD A PLOT TO BLOW UP THE MAINE.                             -----     Witness Before Inquiry Court Tells of a Conversation             Among Spanish Officer, but is Unable              to Give Their Names When Examined.     (Special from a World Staff Correspondent.  Sent from       Havana by The World's Despatch Boat to Key West.)                        On Board The World's Despatch Boat.           The World, Wednesday, March 2, 1898, p. 2                                       Havana, Cuba, March 1. “We are going to blow her up mighty soon.”      That remark is said to have been dropped by a Spanish general on the very day the Maine was destroyed.      Two days afterward a man, whose name we have withheld for fear that if the Spanish authorities learned it they would cause him trouble mysteriously came into the rooms of The World correspondent and said he had a friend who was willing to swear to a conversation he had overheard between two Spanish generals, one Spanish marine officer and a Spanish citizen of Havana.      The person in question was sent by The World correspondent to Gen. Lee, who turned him over to the Naval Court of Inquiry last Friday.  This witness was before that court to testify. He said that on the morning of the day of the explosion he was a passenger on the ferryboat between Guanabacoa and Havana on his way to work; that on the ferryboat were two Spanish generals, one Spanish marine officer and a citizen of Havana; that he heard one General say as the ferryboat was passing the Maine:      “We will not have that ship much longer.  We are going to get rid of her, and she will wish she had never come into our harbor.”      The citizen asked:      “Why, how and when are you going to get rid of her?”      The General answered:      “We are going to blow her up mighty soon.”      The witness, an Italian, who thoroughly understands Spanish, was much impressed with what he had heard, and upon his arrival in Havana he immediately told his friend what he had heard, suggesting that he inform Capt. Sigsbee of the apparent danger his ship was in. 118      His friend advised the witness to keep his mouth shut, as the general was only bluffing, and if he told the conversation he (the witness) might get into trouble.      But the witness was so impressed that when he returned home in the evening he avoided that ferry on account of its proximity to the Maine, taking another line, which landed him nearly a mile further from home.      That night at 9:20 o'clock the explosion occurred.      A clerk in the office of the Consul-General was used as an interpreter when the witness was before the court. The clerk was called before the court again on Saturday. As the witness was unable to give the names of the Spaniards whom he implicated, or to offer any information by which these names could be obtained, the Court of Inquiry doubtless gave his assertion as little weight as they were given by The World correspondent. 119                DIVER OLSEN FACED DEATH BRAVELY                IN THE SUBMERGED MAINE'S HOLD.            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)           The World, Wednesday, March 2, 1898, p. 2 HAVANA, March 1.--Chief Gunner's Mate John Olsen, of the American man-of-war Iowa, has been exploring the wreck of the Maine as a diver for several days. He had an adventure in the wreck that has just become known. A companion was tending the air pump and the life line. The diver was stepping carefully forward in the most broken and twisted portion of the wreck and was hanging perilously to the big bolts that hold the armor-plates.      Suddenly the life line jerked violently out of the seaman's hands and slid down into the water.      Olsen had run into a great bulge in the massive iron hull, had lost his hold and had fallen to the very bottom.      The attendants worked like mad.  The life line became tangled and the diver's life seemed gone.      Suddenly the rope became untangled and up like a shot came the diver, delivered from a horrible death.  Olsen calmly said:      "Well almost any American navy diver would be knocked off his feet running into such a thing; but you bet I wouldn't let it kill me."      Later he said he had been forced into the very centre of the ship by his fall.      Never before in this affair has an expert diver met with such a thrilling experience.  His plucky remark should make him famous.      (The vigilant censor would not allow the name of this diver to be cabled except as “John Doe.”  But as he is the gunner’s mate on the Iowa it is undoubtedly Olsen.—Ed.

Sent from       Havana by The World’s Despatch Boat to Key West.)                          On Board The World’s Despatch Boat,           The World, Wednesday, March 2, 1898, p. 4                                  Havana, Cuba, March 1 1898.      The Spanish Government is so afraid a drop of truth will leak through its controlled cable that the censor red- pencils now even Miss Clara Barton’s dispatches.      He is instructed to kill each truthful word about the Maine and to suppress the fact that there is suffering in Cuba.      The following was handed into the cable office last night to be sent to The World:      “Clara Barton has returned to Havana full of the misery of a small Cuban town.  In Jaruco she saw the ‘reconcentration’ in its real nakedness.  Havana is tame in contrast.      “The town hospital was filthy.  A fearful odor filled the room which contained two men nearly dead.  It came from a dead body that had lain there several days.  One like it had just been removed.      “A day after this awful prelude Miss Barton sent food, medicines and disinfectants in large quantities.  And the destitute thanked God.”                   MISS BARTON TO THE WORLD.      Miss Barton writes as follows to the American people through The World:      “There was but one more incident to mark this memorable day.  After leaving the hospital we were told that a deputation of ladies would call upon us.  They entered slowly and reverently, bearing a plate of choice flowers.      “The spokeswoman handed them to me.  I perceived in the centre a large envelope addressed to me, with a black border and tied with a bow of black ribbon.  Her first trembling sentence told it all: 121 ‘For the dead of the Maine.’ CLARA BARTON.”                AFFECTIONATE TRIBUTE OF CUBANS.      “The envelope had the following touching tribute, here translated literally:      “More strong than a thousand official demonstrations, no matter how splendid or delicate, is the heart message from the grateful country-women, an expression of condolence tendered by the countrymen of Jaruco (succored in their miseries by American charity) to the sorrowful parents relatives and friends of the victims of the unfortunate accident which occurred to the United States cruiser Maine on the fifteenth of February, 1898, and to the American Government.      “Miss Clara Barton, the dignified President of the American International Red Cross:  No better than you (who exercises the most holy of all virtues—charity) could be selected to convey our words of condolence to those who to- day suffer the consequences of an irreparable loss, which we justly appreciate, having also experienced considerable sufferings in this town, where you see only misery and desolation.”                    ADMIRATION OF AMERICA.      “When the destitute countrymen of Jaruco were being circled by the black shadows of despair they saw a ray of hope—a charitable hand extended across the seas and bearing in the name of that great country shadowed by the Capitol at Washington the charitable loaf of bread.      “Grand is your country in virtues, in progress.  True friend of truth, justice and liberty, your high sentiments carry their beneficial influence to all parts of the globe, where they are appreciated equally by the Malayas of the Pacific islands, by the unfortunate Christians of Armenia (abandoned to the power of the Turks), by the people and governments of Europe and by black tribes of Africa redeemed from barbarism and atrocities by American missionaries—real volunteers of charity.      “When our pleasure and gratitude had reached its highest mark—due to alms received from our brothers the Americans—a finish of light illuminated Havana on the night of Feb. 15 and a thunder reached our ears (in spite of the great distance from the capital) as a mournful expression of the great mishap which buried in the sea a great number of official representatives of that power which does us so much good.”                       EULOGY OF HEROES.      “To further increase the great sufferings experienced 122 five heroes sacrificed their lives to save us from an immense mishap.  Great has been the loss experienced in the wrecking of the Maine, and no less great is the heroic action of those five marine guards who descended to flood the magazines, averting by their bravery numberless losses.      “Peace and glory to the martyrs to their duty and their comrades.      “Such an unexpected mishap swells all hearts and causes general mournfulness through international duty, companionship and sympathy.  If consolation be possible in these supreme moments of anguish, we tender it to the families of those noble victims to the American Government and their most generous people through the kind hands of Miss Clara Barton. “THE COUNTRY PEOPLE OF JARUCO AND NEIGHBORS OF THIS      FEUDAL CITY OF CUBA.”             CENSOR’S PENCIL PERNICIOUSLY ACTIVE.      When the censor got to “in Jaruco she saw the ‘reconcentration’ in its real nakedness” his red pencil started and continued over page after page until the correspondent took the cable sheets away from him.      They follow by mail for proof of what Spain does not like to admit.      The beautiful, sincere sentiments of the poor women for a national calamity were much too good for a substitute censor to cut to pieces.      Although no investigation has been done in the tell- tale Maine wreck for four days, the iron facts discovered up to then—all in the same direction have impressed the very palace.      There are sober faces there.  The truth seems to have driven home.
