The other of the seventeen bodies will join the procession upon starting.  The room is not large enough for all to lie in state.      The plain coffins are liberally covered with wreaths and designs of flowers.  Personal gifts abound.      Real sympathy is shown by several, notably one from the Cuban girls of Havana.  Among the most prominent are wreaths from the army and navy in Cuba, the Havana Yacht Club, the Diario Del Ejercko (Army Daily), the Ward line, Lawton Childs & Co., the Pilots’ Association, the Government of the city and Joseph Pulitzer.      A flash-light portrait is now being taken for The World of the scene in front of the palace.      The large Plaza de Armas is filled with people.  Two ranks of really fine-looking bluejackets from the Spanish warship Alfonso XII. are in line on one side.  They deserve to be the guard of honor, for they worked like heroes to 43 save the few struggling maimed Maine men now recovering in Ambrosio Hospital.      At one corner sit six horsemen, the honorary guard of the city.      The sky is dim and their silver helmets flash in the murky air.  The rest of the streets about the plaza are filled with carriages.      Capt.-Gen. Blanco is standing upon the balcony overlooking the square.  Occasionally he bows to the crowd to give official sanction to their presence.      The old Cuban laws forbid him to attend the obsequies of strangers.      The Mayor: Marquis De Esteban, is surrounded by his councilors in black, wearing red and yellow ribbons and their pendant medals.      The air is close to suffocation and every soldier, ruler, lawyer, official, and civilian is oppressed.  There is a curiously depressed look on all faces, widely different from the pure sympathy of the evident outsider.      Two magnificent military bands alternate in classic dirges.      The coffins are being carried down the wide marble stairs between rows of silent men.  The cortege is preparing to start.      The chaplain gives me the names of the victims.  They are Tierking, seaman; Graham, ship’s yeoman; Tinsman, landsman; Serg Brown, marine; Mero, machinist; Keyes, seaman; Sheridan, fireman; Gaffney, fireman; Cosgrove, fireman; Seery, fireman; Golfin, seaman; Kane, doubtful.      These are all who could be identified.  The others were mangled horribly.      The news has just arrived from San Ambrosio Hospital that two men have just died.      One is C. Smith, seaman; the name of the other is as yet unknown.  Smith was badly burned and injured internally.      More bodies are coming out of the depths of the wreck. They are less mangled than the first bodies found and apparently were further from the point of explosion.      The volunteer firemen of Havana carried the coffins of The Maine victims from the palace into twelve gorgeous funeral cars drawn by gaudily caparisoned horses.      The great public square is full of people.  The Hotel Inglaterra and the balconies of half a dozen clubs are crowded with spectators.  The Spanish Casino is jammed. Muffled drums and white plumes advise ear and eye that the procession is approaching.  The spectators are laughing and 44 chattering unaware of the terrible significance of the affair.      Troops are marching in slow time and the advance horsemen stoop every twenty yards awaiting the followers.      A squad of the Honorary Municipal Squadron, leading the magnificently mounted procession, has commenced to pass now.      After its dirging band comes the red-shirted leather hatted volunteer firemen, and following them come the separate companies in various firemen’s dress, four in all, and counting two hundred.  They are nearly all Cubans.      Now comes the most remarkable sight—one hundred reconcentrados, thin and pale.  They can hardly walk faster than the funeral [. . .].      There are black-shawled women among them.  Some are crying.  A by-stander says, “A good stroke.”      But be it stroke or not, these men and women rescued from starvation by American food are themselves sincere. They do not know they are being used for effect; they are grateful and they are showing it—a most touching thing.      The funeral coaches come next, each gorgeous in gilt and varnish, with the tops of most of them piled with floral emblems.      A powerful four-horse hose-carriage passes with six coffins upon it, and another comes with five.      There were not hearses enough.  The crowd is talking of the fact that 400 more starving Cubans are to join the procession later on.      The twelve hearses pass and a splendid military band, playing a quickstep, precedes 300 Spanish marines and sailors from the Alfonso XII. in purple robes.      The municipal heralds-head the Mayor and corporation officers of Havana.  All are stepping slowly.  The ancient emblematic mace is carried aloft. Men are in frock coats or evening dress.      Gov. Bruson and the Autonomist Cabinet follow.      Consul-General Lee passes with Capt. Sigsbee.  Both look terribly.  They have gone through an awful trial by fire.  The captain of the Fern and other officers were in full naval dress.  The Maine’s officers’ gold braid uniforms are at the bottom of Havana Harbor with their men.      I can hear a low murmur of sympathy as they pass. Other Maine officers follow their captain.      Vice-Consul Springer and the consular force pass. Then Gen. Parrado, the venerable Bishop and the chief of the Spanish staff in gorgeous robes.      They were succeeded by fully two hundred officers                              45 representing all arms and branches of Spain’s army and Navy.  All halt before the Hotel Inglaterra.      The air has been moist all day, not a few drops of rain fall.      Carriages drive up and officers, diplomats, officials and American representatives take them in the same order as that in which they had marched.      The pageant has passed.      Officially Spain has paid the highest honors in her power to the dead.      Official courtesy could go no further.      To the Americans who objected to a Spanish burial of American sailors the spectacular parade was maddening. 46                 HAVANA’S MAYOR TO THE WORLD.                             -----               He Addresses the American People                  Through the Columns of Its                      Greatest Newspaper.                    (Special to The World.)

The World, Friday, February 18, 1898, p. 5                                             Havana, Feb. 17.      A few feet of the twisted iron of what remains of the great battle-ship Maine shows above the water of the harbor to-day; marking the tomb of 251 of our sailors.  All talk to-day is of who did it.      Spanish fanaticism might have done it.  Cuban intriguers might have caused it, and it might have happened through carelessness.      Two hundred and fifty-one sleeping sailors went to the sharks of Havana Harbor by one of these things.  It was most decidedly not the last one.      It was not accidental either.  Cubans or Spanish floated the torpedo under the water line against the Maine’s forward magazine, or, while visiting the ship, secreted in the afternoon a time bomb near the tons of piled powder.      Either was put there by men of one faction or the other.      On this depends war with Spain or a disgusted dropping of everything Cuban, and the Cubans may give up all hope. Either every other ship of the United States Navy steams to bombard Spain’s richest towns or every ship stops filibustering.  There are 251 brave sailor lads mangled and burned and dead under the filthy, inky waters of Havana Harbor with the sharks.                  NO SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION.      There was no fire from “physical cause” to produce the explosion. 48      Modern magazines have no “spontaneous combustion” and, as I already cabled, the bulkheads were tightly screwed shut and the keys handed to Capt. Sigsbee at 8 o’clock at night.  They were found this morning hanging in their proper bag in his stateroom.      From her arrival in Havana Harbor, with her gun cylinders filled, ammunition-hoists in readiness and turrets manned, the always strict discipline of the splendidly officered Maine was redoubled under the stricter vigilance of her Captain.  It was no accident which caused the disaster.          RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MAINE’S DESTRUCTION.  I have been aboard American men-of-war from Alaskan waters to the Mediterranean in The World’s service and I have never seen such exquisite watchfulness on any ship foreign or native as Sigsbee has mentioned upon the Maine. There were two Spaniards, born in the Island of Majora in the crew. They are dead. Their surviving shipmates say they were asleep in their hammocks when the iron rent and the water rushed in. They did not do it.                   DETAILS OF THE DISASTER.      Arriving at the water front ten minutes after the shock, I found a dazed crowd of police and officers, gazing speechless at a mass of protruding, wrenched iron beams bursting with fire. It was the Maine.      Chief of Police Col. Pagliere was there.  He, with George Bronson Rea of Harper’s Weekly, and myself took the first stunned boatman we could arouse and started swiftly toward the blazing pile which twenty minutes before had been the battle-ship Maine.      Her superstructure alone loomed up, partly colored by the red glare of the flames glancing upon the black water.      At first, it appeared as if her bow was totally demolished.  Then the mass of twisted beams and braces was seen that was blown forward by the awful rending.      One hundred yards away we were stopped by floating wreckage, and moans and agonized cries could be heard. Naval boats were alongside.  Most were from the Spanish cruiser.                    HEATED SHELLS EXPLODED.      The boats had been in the water almost simultaneously with the explosion, so prompt were they.  The fire reached some small cannon ammunition in the decks and projectile after projectile whizzed into the air past us.  But the Spanish Colonel caned our boatmen and they kept on.      The after half of the ship had not been broken, and there against her were the saving boats. 49      In the sharp glare of the flames lay the naked body of a sailor.  He writhed, and the magnificent muscles of his arms and chest strained like cables.  He moaned in agony.      I hailed for officers, and from a boat six yards away came the response:  “Here!  Some of us are here.”  The loss was not even guessed at then.  Capt. Sigsbee had just boarded his cutter, one of the few of the Maine’s boats entire.  The Spanish oarsmen were speechless.  They bent their oars at the slightest sign of human life afloat, and their officers worked like mad. They knew what it all meant. Officers and men of the Maine’s rescued crew were without coats. But few had been on deck when the awful end came. Some were naked. The fixed ammunition crashed faster and faster, and Sigsbee ordered all hands aboard the City of Washington.                    PICKING UP MANGLED MEN.      The City of Washington was lying not over four hundred feet astern of the blazing, sunken steel coffin of hundreds of dead men. The surrounding water had been closely searched and thirty-four men, whole and wounded, had already been rowed to the Alfonso XII. about six hundred feet distant.      Seven were being bandaged at the Government Wharf Machine under the assiduous guard of Havana’s Cuban corps of firemen in uniform, who were immediately summoned.      Sixteen men were taken in the last sad little flotilla to the Ward liner.  Spanish doctors came aboard to attend them.  Laid about in the ship’s dining saloon they were stretched out, but none made a whimper, although they were suffering with torn flesh, broken bones and bleeding gashes.      A curious fact is that J.J. Blandin and John Hood, Lieutenants, were respectively in the two historical wrecks of the Kearsarge at Roneador Reef and the Trenton in Apia Harbor. Col. Pagilera was the first Spanish representative to board the Washington.      “In the name of the Captain-General I wish to offer you the most sincere condolence and to know what you may have to say as to the awful affair, and its causes.”                    SIGSBEE’S STERN REPLY.      Capt. Sigsbee stood stern and straight.  His head was bound in a handkerchief.  Navigation Officer Holman was at his side.  The Washington crew had seen and felt the awful explosion.  They stood by with jaws like steel and eyes aflame.      They had been told the Spanish Government buoy to                              50 which the Maine had been moored was surrounded by submarine Government mines.  The electric light threw the faces and muscles of the sailors into the tensest relief.      Capt. Sigsbee answered: “I cannot state more than that we are blown up until I closely investigate.”                    SIGSBEE AND THE HERO MARINE.      Capt. Sigsbee bears the calamity like an American officer and a gentlemen.  He was not even outwardly ruffled by the awful calamity.  He received the Spanish Chief of Police as calmly as though his quarter deck were not a wreck and his men mangled and drowned.  Apropos of this, it is told of Capt. Sigsbee that he was writing a letter to his wife in his port cabin when the explosion occurred. All the lights were instantly extinguished.  Sigsbee, running out, bumped into a perfectly-disciplined marine orderly, who, amid shrieks, groans, flames, and horror, and in the dark, saluted and said: “Sir, I have to inform you that the ship has been blown up and is sinking.”      What a soldier!      He should be decorated by Congress.      The brave marine is named William Anthony: He said to me to-day, when I spoke of it:  “Oh, that’s nothing: any Yankee marine would do that.”      One other meritorious action is by William H. Van Sickel, an elderly man, the manager of the Havana Standard Oil Works, who went out to the wreck in his launch and found that the gunner who had accompanied Surgeon Brunner to search the wreck had become crazed by work and horror and had climbed the remaining armored mast. Van Sickel went after the man and put him aboard the launch by main force. He was the last man to leave the burning Maine.      The coolness was noticeable everywhere among the men, and when the boats and their maimed loads had left the creek for the hospital there was no jabbering, no excitement.  The officers who had something to do did it quietly.  The others said nothing.  All stood this Samoa of Fire as others once gave three cheers for the British warship Calliope, at the Pacific Samoa of Hurricane.                  FORWARD MAGAZINE EXPLODED.      All the wreckage, by personal observation, simply shows the effect of tremendous explosive force.  All the Maine’s officers unite in the opinion that the forward starboard 10-inch magazine exploded, cause unknown.  The World diver will determine whether it was interior or exterior.      But a torpedo was used.                              51 The plain double report of Gen. Lee and Capt. Sigsbee shows this in connection with the fact that there is much more fracture on one side of the magazine than on the other.      The Maine sank like a shot.  The biggest damage is on the starboard side.  The “Big Ten” magazine went up, too.      Lieutenant-Commander Wainwright is now in charge of the wreck.
