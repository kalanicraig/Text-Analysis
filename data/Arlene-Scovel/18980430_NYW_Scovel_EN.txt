GIVE US ARMS! SAYS GEN. GOMEZ.                             -----        There Is No Need of Sending Many United States         Troops Into the Island of Cuba, If Only That                   Be Done and Done Quickly.                             -----           GOMEZ’S MEN WILL HAMMER AT HAVANA’S GATE.                             -----   With the Interior Cut Off and Sampson’s Fleet Thundering           From the Sea, Spain’s Power in Cuba Will                   Speedily Come to an End.                             -----                    (Special to The World.)           The World, Thursday, April 30, 1898, p. 1      KEY WEST, Fla., April 29.—No volunteer troops are needed in Cuba and very few regulars will be sufficient. It would be criminal to send 50,000 American soldiers over the Gulf Stream.  Not because of epidemic disease.  There is no such a thing in the country in Cuba.  Not because of loss of life in great engagement.  There is no necessity in having them.      But to send many men to Cuba would be criminal because useless.  They are not needed.  Rifles, cartridges, food, clothing, mules—yes, most emphatically yes!  There are 30,000 there to use them.  They are native born.  They have learned Spanish military methods, until they seemingly only have to hear of a column of troops six miles away to know just what it will do, just when and just how.  They have learned it by thirteen years of practical experience.  They are brave.  “Thirty thousand against 250,000” proves that, without going into relative armament, food supply, transportation and communication, all immensely in favor of the greater numbers.      The World’s commission has not yet returned from Gomez.  It is certain he will say, “Give me artillery, munitions and mule trains, and I can do the rest.”  He can. He could not, were Cuba’s topography and climate European or American.  He could not, had Blanco intelligent officers and good supply bases.      But the exact military situation in Cuba to-day is just the condition for Gomez to utilize if armed and supplied.  He has at the lowest estimate 30,000 men who have handled arms and are accustomed to Spanish fire.  The enthusiastic Cuban Junta probably claims 100,000.  The truthful Gomez put it last January at 25,000.  There are 275 undoubtedly 150,000 in Cuba available for armament.      But the estimate of 30,000 men now ready for business only includes Cuban soldiers, neither employees of the civil government organizations nor “rancheros.”  The fathers and the supporters of families living in the woods having failed to obey Weyler’s reconcentration bando are included.  They, however, would be very useful as they now are as scouts, and many would undoubtedly join the [. . .] forces.      Fully armed, equipped and supplied, Gomez and Garcia [. . .] little physical assistance clear the island of Spanish bases and Spanish food, and of themselves compel the quick surrender of all the outside of Havana, Matanzas and Cienfuegos.  These ports and their corralled forces can be starved or taken at Sampson’s will.      Take a map of Cuba and note the fact that all Spanish supplies come first to Havana.  That is Cuba’s military heart.  The further away from that the [. . .] is each Spanish post in food and munitions.  And they are absurdly weak at their best.  Ex-Spanish Minister Canalejas admitted last November that the Spanish troops were starving.  There never was a surplus in any base except the three mentioned. There is less now.  There will be nothing soon.  This means death to Cuban non-combatants—our protegeo—as well as to Spanish military movement and the island should be taken quickly.      This is what Gomez can do.  Ask him what he wants, then send Gomez what he wants and where he wants it, and at once.      Knowing that cartridges in plenty are soon and surely to come, Gomez can see what ammunition he has in the total disablement of every railroad in Cuba.  They have only been allowed to run heretofore because they have paid heavy insurgent taxes.  There is now no Spanish water transportation, and with the railroads gone, the poorly supplied Spanish bases would be absolutely isolated.      This can all be accomplished by the time breech- loading Springfield rifles, cartridges, supplies and mules can be got to the Cuban coast.      Eastern Cuba need not be considered.  Spain is weakest there.  Garcia has perhaps 12,000 men.  Spain’s best fighting General, Seguara, told me last December that Garcia had 16,000 armed soldiers.  As soon as supplied Garcia could desert Eastern Cuba and march as only Cubans can march, due west.  His is the best discipline considerable force in Cuba.      Garcia would need four companies of United States 276 cavalry.  Our infantry could not wisely attempt to keep up with hardened Cuban foot soldiers.  I have seen these march forty miles a day for seven days, and on almost nothing but sugarcane for food.  No artillery would seem necessary to this eastern chief.  There is no important town in that department but Santiago, and that is located and can last be considered.      One transport landing at a point on the south coast nearest Garcia would equip him.  One Government tug or torpedo-boat could keep abreast of his position and maintain communication between Garcia and Gomez and the United States Government.  Remember, the island is a ribbon, and the quickest way, other than by rail, to communicate between the eastern and western or central portions is by ass.      Gomez could march at once.  He might have twenty-five pieces, one troop of cavalry and one regiment of regular infantry from the States.  What are called forts in Cuba are square holes in the ground with wooden covers.  None have artillery.  A few are small masonry guardhouses.  The average garrison is about thirty men.  There are none of these which cannot be quickly reduced by a 27-inch field- piece, and no town has over a dozen of them.      Our cavalry and infantry would serve as stiffening examples to the native troops.  The only reason these two are necessary is just that.  They are needed in Cuba for nothing else.  And their moral effect is all Gomez requires to make good soldiers of his men if once armed.      Arms and munitions can be easily landed within forty miles of Gomez’s present position.  He will need little forage while crossing Santa Clara Province.  There is excellent grazing there.  Matanzas has remaining much sugarcane also.  Gomez could take Sancti Spiritus.  Santa Clara and every smaller town on his line of march without much interfering with his progress, and Garcia, marching light, could catch him in two weeks near Matanzas.  If quicker junction were desired, Garcia’s men could be put aboard transports and landed near Gomez in a very few days.      Gomez can pick up all the local Cuban forces on his march, and, with Garcia from the east, and meeting Mayla Rodriguez from Pinar del Rio, arrive behind Havana in three weeks with 20,000 men.      From the moment the railroads are broken the smaller cities of Cuba will hold, practically useless, fully two- thirds of the Spanish Army of about 30,000 able-bodied men. There is nothing to eat in the country that Spanish troops could find or that would support their numbers ten days if 277 they did discover its hidden plantation.  Every incident of three years’ observation of Spanish military characteristics show that once cut off from communication with the interior the Spanish forces will simply stay in the towns, or, if they march at all, it will have to be toward Havana, and they could easily and separately be intercepted and detained.      Once at Havana, if 20,000 Cubans and United States artillery is not enough, combined with the marine forces, then more United States regulars can be sent.      They need not go before.  There never was a struggle so little understood as the Cuban-Spanish one.  Spain’s troops are not generally known to be now practically useless, from a military point of view, though the crass stupidity of Spanish officers.  They are brave, but they do not know how to conduct troops.  The men themselves are magnificently steady and calm, but they have never been drilled.  They do not know how to shoot.  Add to these radical and blighting defects the starved condition of the troops and clearly we are overestimating the Spanish army in Cuba, and we greatly and criminally underestimate the Cubans if we do not immediately enable them to fight vigorously. 278              SAMPSON CHECKED BY ADMINISTRATION.                             -----       Analysis of the Plan of Attack Favored By Admiral                Sampson and His Chief of Staff.                             -----                 THEY HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION                  WILL SEE THE WISDOM OF IT.                             -----       It Would Mean Quick, Hot Work at Short Range and          Certain Capture of the Spanish Stronghold.                             -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)           On board The World Despatch Boat Triton,         April 27, 2.30 P.M. (via Key West. April 29).           The World, Saturday, April 30, 1898, p. 2      The blockade is a fact.  Havana is fenced in by steel. But the misery of it all is that the Cubans will starve before the Spaniards feel one hunger pang.  Big transatlantic liners have for two weeks been crowding into Havana harbor, laden and deck-loaded with food.  It has been only for Spaniards, who are those who have the money, and for Spanish soldiers who at least must be fed by their Government.  Cubans must starve.  They cannot buy; they have no money, and their only means of obtaining food for wives and little ones will now be to shoulder Spanish rifles.      The World’s latest Havana despatches show the earnestness of the Spaniards.  Naturally and doggedly tenacious, they will resist mere blockade indefinitely. And American ships will be starving the very people whom America sent them there to save.  To live, Havana Cubans must turn traitors to their own country and be armed enemies to their benefactors.      Admiral Sampson obeys his blockading orders with energy and with sorrow.  He feels, however, that the Administration will soon see the futility of a plan which starves our allies before it touches our enemy, and will allow him to act.  The Admiral’s real wish, and the plan most vigorously held by his chief of staff, Capt. Chidwick, was to make quick, hot work at short range.  Eight hundred yards and 13-inch guns these officers hold, would make short work of Havana’s only defenses against approach from the northwest, the Santa Clara and Vedado batteries.  It 279 must be all over in two hours.      Strategic objectors in Washington influenced Secretary Long and President McKinley, and a week ago they absolutely forbade any direct attack.  Their idea was that should we lose one or two battle-ships, and were Spain’s combined navy to cross the seas and attack we would be out-weighted. Secretary Long also stated the impossibility of buying battle-ships.  Ready-made “tin ships” are all that can be bought, he thinks.      Admiral Sampson readily gave up carefully-studied, minutely-detailed and cherished plans for attacking Havana’s new batteries, and formulated the Mariando Bay scheme of a demonstration and an ultimatum, and the consequent speedy Spanish evacuation of Havana or its safe bombardment.      This plan seems perfect.  It may now be fully described.      Capt.-Gen. Blanco has neither the guns, the torpedoes nor the time to prepare further against it.  Mariando Bay’s position would enable Admiral Sampson to capture Havana infinitely sooner than by blockade, and with a thousand times more humanity.      The Vedado battery possesses only four guns which could bear upon any battle-ship and monitor inside Mariando Bay or at its mouth.  They are not over eight-inch.  Holmes puts them at six, and so do our Government drawings. Nothing else in Havana bears far enough westward except the second Vedado battery of rifled mortars.  Even these would have to be remounted to point properly and all the complicated calculations for their fire would require careful revision.  Before this could be done Gen. Blanco would have had to surrender or sustain hopeless, useless bombardment from a powerful fleet at short range for the ships, but at an impossible angle for the good guns of Havana’s only formidable (Santa Clara) battery.  No gun, mortar or otherwise east of Morro could be used at all. Even with his Vedado mortar battery Gen. Blanco would be pitifully powerless.  He would have six eight-inch rifled mortars, bunglingly handled as if proved by the recent projectile practice cabled to The World, and four modern guns, not over eight-inch.  The main batteries of the Iowa and Indiana and three monitors alone count twenty guns, all ten-inch or over in caliber.      With his five big-gunned ships in Marianao Bay, Admiral Sampson would, indeed, have Havana at his mercy. Lying to in smooth water, well sheltered from prevailing easterly winds, and undisturbed by any but comparative 280 pellets from the enemy, well-trained American gunners could demolish Havana’s defenses east and west of Morro as calmly and accurately as if on big-gun target practice.      There is plenty of water in the bay for five widely- separated fighting ships.  The World’s tug Triton has called in there three times returning from coast appointments with World correspondents and has taken frequent soundings each time.  The shallowest water we could find twelve fathoms (60 feet) was not over half a mile from shore, at the end of the bay.  Out one hundred yards into the bay the man at the lead line habitually sang out:  “No bottom,” which meant a depth of over fifteen fathoms.  Our big ships could almost tie up to the banks in Marianao Bay.  And this great depth of water according to Capt. Chidwick, renders most difficult the proper placing of torpedoes, especially with the strong tide which exists here.      Should Admiral Sampson be allowed to take this sure and speedy road to Blanco’s palace, his ships would enter from the northwest and would be exposed to Santa Clara’s big guns for only about half an hour, and that at a six to seven mile range: five is thought to be enough.  Ensign Powelson and I saw them make just two line shots out of twenty at three-mile range, and they were shooting right out at sea, not at the extreme angle of the embrasures.      Once in the bay and completely sheltered from the big guns, Admiral Sampson could demand surrender within twelve hours.  In case of refusal he could begin bombardment within twenty-four hours, and our projectiles could be so directed as to do greatest damage to the defenses and very little to non-combatants.  Havana’s water front and her batteries would like all in line from the fleet, and every good line shot would hit something belonging to the Spanish Government and almost nothing of private property, which would all lie off to the right of the line of fire.      If after bombardment a landing is deemed advisable, it could be easily effected.  The bay furnishes a splendid beach, large enough for the simultaneous disembarkation of 20,000 men, right under the guns of the fleet, which could then anchor within one hundred yards of the shore.      Spain’s grave military blunder in placing her modern batteries may be made the most of and Havana can be taken without Cuban starvation, without loss to non-combatants, with moderate loss of life to the Spanish soldiers, and almost free of casualties on our side.      I submitted to Admiral Sampson the soundings, the bearings and the characteristics of the bay.  Mr. Hare’s 281 photographs reached him by a torpedo-boat from Key West, where the Triton took them when she carried the first news of the fleet’s approach to Havana for The World.      Our fleet can now enter at night, if necessary, and avoid Havana’s big guns altogether. 282 HEILBERG WILL MAKE A SECOND DASH INTO HAVANA.                             -----        Brave Courier Goes to Get News of the Blockaded            City and to Learn the Fate of Intrepid                  World Correspondent Holmes.                             -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)          On board The World's despatch boat Triton,         off the Cuban coast, via Key West, April 29.           The World, Saturday, April 30, 1898, p. 4      That bravest of men, Courier Heilberg, is to be landed again to-night.      He faces the fact that Spanish troops are all along the coast and patrols and guerilla scouting parties are everywhere.      Heilberg goes to communicate with World correspondent Holmes or at least discover his fate.  This daring correspondent, it will be remembered, failed to appear the two appointed nights of this week for him to have been taken off by the Admiral.      Both he and Heilberg had made one successful trip in and out from Havana.  Their information was valuable, and no effort will be spared to get them both back again.      The outlying cruisers are hungry for news.      “Where's the flying squadron?” they ask.  “What are the Spanish doing?”  “Have they left Cape Verde?” and principally, “Are we ever going to fight?”      These questions are megaphoned at the Triton by every ship passed.      In running down the coast we were brought up to each ship by an authoritative puff of white cannon smoke and each officer in charge [. . .] said:      “We can't tell, you know, who you are any distance off.”      But the Triton's mate said:      “I'll be durned if them fellows don't round us up to get the news.”      If they did, no blame to them, for on the blockading steel hulls [. . .] for action, on choppy water, and under a tropical sun, with no news, is not a life of luxurious ease.
