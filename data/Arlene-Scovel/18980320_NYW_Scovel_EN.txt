HAVANA IS LIKE A VOLCANO                   ON THE VERGE OF ERUPTION                             -----    Americans in Hourly Danger and Wholesale Assassination            Might Follow a Declaration of War—Open         Hostilities Generally Expected by the Public.  (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World, Sent from     Havana to Key West by The World’s Despatch Steamer.)       On Board The World’s Despatch Steamer Confidence.            The World, Sunday, March 20, 1898, p. 3                                     Havana Harbor, March 19.      Havana for Americans is still a volcano that may break forth at any moment.  Quiet it cannot be truthfully called.      There are no riots in the streets, no direct insults to Americans.  Only scowls and murmurings whenever an American passes a group of volunteers or orden publicos.      In Spanish restaurants waiters will bring an American’s dinner a little bit slower than they will any one else’s.  Spanish officers at the little round tables will nudge each other and whisper “un Americano,” while they look at you with an expression of combined pity and scorn.      A rich Cuban, a conservative man of great refinement, whose family are now in New York and who expects to return there himself, said to-day: “I asked a Spanish colonel at the Union Club last night whether he expected there would ever be war between Spain and the United States.  ‘No,’ he replied, ‘because the Yankees are afraid to fight.  But I want to tell you, though, that if their Government in Washington ever does declare war, on the first night the news reaches Havana we will rise, and beginning with Gen. Lee, we will do to every American and every reconcentrado this’—and he threw back his head and drew his thumb across his throat.  ‘You Americans do not realize how a Spaniard can handle a knife.  When the storm breaks your heads come off quick, sir.’”      That is it, when the storm breaks!  Everybody seems to take it for granted it certainly will break, and quickly too, in spite of all Blanco and the moderate Autonomists can do to postpone it.      Dr. Congosto said to-day:  “Yes, there are rowdies and rascals in Havana.  As there are everywhere else in the 191 world.  Men have been sandbagged within three blocks of the Waldorf, haven’t they?  Is the United States Government to blame?  In just the same way, if some of the lower elements here attack an American do not blame us for it.  We have done all in our power to protect Americans and every one else.”      Every one at the palace, in the mediaeval blindness that characterizes all Spanish minds, is ridiculing the idea of the Maine explosion being caused by any exterior cause.  Blanco will not even allow the subject to be broached to him.  He regards as a personal insult to him an expression of the slightest doubt that the Maine disaster was the result of an accident.
