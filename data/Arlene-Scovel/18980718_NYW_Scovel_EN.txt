UP GO STARS AND STRIPES O'ER SANTIAGO AT LAST.                             -----            Cheering Crowds Welcome Shafter--Bands                      Play National Airs.                             -----                      SPAIN'S TROOPS LAY                       DOWN THEIR ARMS.                             -----                  Opposing Generals Meet at a                    Banquet to Discuss the                      Results of Battle.                             -----  (Special Cable Despatch from a World Staff Correspondent.)          The World, Monday, July 18, 1898, pp. 1, 2      SANTIAGO, July 17.--At noon to-day the American flag was hoisted over the city of Santiago, while in the streets of the ancient town our bands played ÒThe Star-Spangled Banner.Ó      Officers and men reverently saluted the colors as they went sailing up the tall staff which a few hours before had supported the yellow and red emblem of Spain.      At 9 A. M. the Spanish flag was lowered from Morro Castle.      Steam launches from the New York, Brooklyn and Vixen entered the harbor and examined the batteries, the wrecks of the Merrimac and the sunken Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes, and the torpedo-firing stations.  They discovered six Spanish merchant steamers and one small gunboat in the harbor, and a prize crew was placed upon the latter.      This afternoon the torpedoes were taken up or exploded, after which the Red Cross steamer State of Texas entered to give assistance to the sick and wounded in the city.  The warships may not enter the harbor for several days.      The hoisting of our flag over the city meant its actual occupation by our troops.  At 11 A. M. the official entrance to the town began.  As soon as possession had been taken Gen. Chambers McKibben was appointed Military Governor of Santiago.                     NINTH INFANTRY FIRST.      The first troops to enter were the men of the Ninth Infantry.  The position of honor was given them as a reward for their heroic assault on San Juan hill during the first days of the fighting against Santiago.      Gen. Shafter and his staff as they rode into the town 343 were escorted by the Second Cavalry.      As the Ninth entered the city the spectacle was thrilling.  The balconies of the houses were crowded with people.  Many of them waved a welcome to our men.  Others showed their satisfaction more quietly.      From none came threats or words of discontent.  Even the Spanish soldiers massed about took the arrival of our men, their victors, calmly.                  GOOD ORDER IN THE STREETS.      The best of good order reigned in the streets.  Our men with a splendid sense of the fitness of things, tempered their exultation so as not to wound the pride of their beaten enemies, and the Spaniards philosophically accepted the new condition of affairs.      Gens. Shafter, Wheeler, Kent, Lawton, Ames, Sumner and McKibbin rode straight to the Captain-General's palace, where they were met by the municipal authorities, the Archbishop of Santiago and the generals of the defeated Spanish army.      Genes. Toral and Yacario and their staffs received our generals with every possible courtesy.                    GEN. LINARES'S REGRETS.      Gen. Toral apologized for the non-appearance of Lieut.-Gen. Linares who was prevented from being present by a serious wound.  He will call and pay his respects to Gen. Shafter as soon as he is able to leave his cot.      An elaborate dinner was prepared at the Captain- General's palace for fifteen generals, and at this banquet many of the details of the surrender which have not been settled were discussed.      For the present the Spanish municipal authorities will remain in charge of the city.      While our troops were marching into the city the vanguard of the defeated army began to march out, the Spanish soldiers depositing their arms at the edge of the city.  All of the Spanish troops are going into camp on open ground between the former firing lines, where it will be comparatively easy to keep them under control until the arrival of the transports which are to carry them back to Spain.                    SPANIARDS LOOK HUNGRY.      The Spanish soldiers appear to be upon the verge of starvation.  They have been terribly underfed for weeks, and their general emaciation shows it.  They have had nothing to eat but rice, a little coffee and sugar.      Our troops found the entrance streets to Santiago wonderfully entrenched, and all are thanking God they did 344 not have to take the city by assault.  It would have meant fearful slaughter on both sides.      Across each of the main entrance roads were four wire entanglements and six barricades.      To have broken through the wire and carried the barricades one after the other would have meant terrible fighting.  On the San Juan road in particular an assault would have been disastrous.                      PRAISE FOR SHAFTER.      Gen. Shafter is being congratulated by every one for the capitulation he enforced.  It has certainly saved hundreds of good American lives.      Lieut. Rathers, of the Ninth Infantry, was the first American officer to enter the town.  He went in at the head of a small detachment of troops.      El Caney road, leading to Santiago, is terribly congested by returning refugees.  Some of the scenes along this road make the heart ache.      Clara Barton and her Red Cross assistants are doing noble work in relieving the distress.  This afternoon they are feeding hundreds of the poor starved once in the town.      Admiral Sampson will begin the work of clearing the mines from the harbor at once.
