TORAL’S INCLINATION TOWARD SURRENDER.                             -----       Believed that He Will Take Advantage of the First               Opportunity to Do So, Although He                  Refused Shafter’s Demands.                             -----                 SANTIAGO STARVING AND ABLE TO                HOLD OUT BUT A FEW DAYS LONGER.                             -----    Volunteers Charge that Their Officers Showed Cowardice        Under Fire, and a Thorough Investigation of the                   Accusation Is Under Way.                             -----                 (Special Cable Despatch from             a Staff Correspondent of The World.)            The World, Sunday, July 11, 1898, p. 2      MAJOR-GEN. SHAFTER’S HEADQUARTERS, Before Santiago, Cuba, July 9—Via Port Antonio, Jamaica.  July 10.—Gen. Toral will soon surrender unconditionally.      Deserters and prisoners report that this is inevitable, and that the surrender will be made as soon as Gen. Toral thinks he can take this action with honor.      Yesterday Gen. Toral offered to capitulate if he were permitted to take his artillery and march his force in safety to Holguin, one hundred miles to the west of Santiago.      In answer Gen. Shafter briefly repeated his ultimatum, “Unconditional surrender.”      To-day Gen. Toral informed Gen. Shafter he was willing to leave his artillery in the city if his men could retain their rifles and march to Holguin.      Gen. Shafter and his aides expect that to-morrow Gen. Toral will ask only that his officers be allowed to retain their side arms, and that his men, disarmed, be permitted to march to Holguin.                    SHAFTER WILL NOT YIELD      It is as certain as that to-morrow will come that Gen. Shafter will again repeat.  “Unconditional Surrender.”      Every day that passes greatly strengthens the Americans’ position without helping the Spaniards.      No further method of defense is left to Toral: he has exhausted all his resources.      He may construct more mines in the closest approaches to the city and in the very streets, but his mines can easily be avoided or countermined by artillery. 334      Prisoners and deserters report that Toral has thrown up barricades in the streets and is turning the houses on the street corners into temporary forts as strong as he can make them.      But the English cable operators who were admitted to the city so that Toral might consult with Madrid by cable declare the Spaniards cannot possibly hold out for a week longer.      The Spaniards, they say, are praying for rain; the walls and cisterns which supplied water since the water pipes running into the city were cut are exhausted.      So close were the Spaniards to starvation that biscuits were selling for five dollars a pound.      Deserters say the Spaniards have never recovered from the fierceness of the attack of July 1.      Unwilling to call the American soldiers brave, they call them fools.            SAY OUR TROOPS DON’T UNDERSTAND DANGER.      “The pigs charge up the hill like fools,” say the Spaniards.  “They’re madmen, imbeciles!  They don’t know what danger is.”      Outside the city six of our batteries are in such position as to necessitate Toral’s unconditional surrender.      The hills which flank Santiago are occupied by our artillery placed behind sand bags and bomb-proofs.      The United Sates field mortars are extremely well placed and must do great execution.  The American lines have been pushed forward on the flanks, so that the central Spanish trenches will be nearly in a cross fire.      Said Gen. Shafter’s principal aide to-day:      “Whatever damage they may do us, when we open fire on them we can kill every one of them.”                 SAMPSON SENDING GUNS ASHORE.      Admiral Sampson is sending ashore his rapid-fire guns to add to the deadliness of the land bombardment.      On July 7, three deaths occurred in the field hospital:      Silas A. Eagart, private, Troop L, First United States Volunteer Cavalry (Roosevelt’s Rough Riders).      Patrick O’Conner, private, Company D, Seventh United States Infantry.      On July 8:      Charles R. Schwartz, private, First United States Cavalry. On July 9:      Noah Prince, private, Troops S., Ninth United States Cavalry. 335 Only fifty-four sick and wounded men remain in the hospital.  They are convalescing, and unless there are unexpected complications all should recover.      Gen. Linares’s wound is healing.      There is no yellow fever among the United States troops.      Clara Barton’s Red Cross physicians and nurses are doing noble work.  The army surgeons say they would scarcely be able to properly attend the wounded without the aid of the Red Cross.      Miss Barton is of invaluable service too in attending to the feeding of the refugees from Santiago, for Gen. Shafter is kept busy furnishing supplies to his own men and the Cuban soldiers.      THE SPIRIT OF THE MEN IN THE TRENCHES IS IMPROVING DAILY.  IT NEVER WAS LOW, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THE SEVENTY-FIRST NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS, WHOSE SOLDIERS BITTERLY ACCUSE SEVERAL OFFICERS OF COWARDICE UNDER FIRE.  A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE CONDUCT OF THESE OFFICERS IS GOING FORWARD.
