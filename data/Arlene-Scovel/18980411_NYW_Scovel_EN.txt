PRESIDENT M’KINLEY WILL NOT WAIT.             HIS MESSAGE GOES TO CONGRESS TO-DAY.                             -----        “Look Well at Those Flags,” Says Consul-General       Lee, Pointing to the Spanish Bunting Over Havana.           “You Will Never See Them Again in Cuba.”                             -----               “YOU WILL WHISTLE ANOTHER TUNE.”               IS HIS COMMENT ON SPANISH JEERS.                             -----      Gen. Lee Has Lived in Daily Danger of Assassination             Two Years and Has Suffered Insult and                   Neglect for Duty’s Sake.                             -----             (Special from a Staff Correspondent.) (On Board U.S.S. Fern, Key West, Fla. April 10.) The World, Monday, April 11, 1898, pp. 1, 2      When leaving Havana yesterday afternoon Consul-General Lee turned to veteran Consular Clerk Doiz, who has been in the Consulate longer than any one remembers, and said:      “Doiz, look at those flags.”  He pointed to the masses of yellow and red bunting all jubilantly fluttering in officially religious honor of Holy Saturday.  Every stick of Havana afloat or ashore had its colors.  “Doiz,” said Lee, “Look at those flags, look close at them.  You’ll never see them again in Cuba.”      This saying is General Lee’s real heartfelt view of the present situation.  He awaited the compensating moment for two years of treachery and starvation.      A soldier, he saw, from the first Havana day, the awful massacre quick and slow, by sword or by hunger, of non-combatant Cubans which in Cuba has dishonored the name of war and of civilization.  He once said:      ”Yes, I have sometimes almost lost heart.  The struggle promised to be so long drawn out as to only weary the American people.  I thought action impossible at times.”      When personally warm and officially cool Gen. Fitzhugh Lee saw Morro astern, he felt like one freed from a fetid cell.                 LEE OVERJOYED AT HIS RELEASE.      When he left foul Havana Harbor and its howling ruffians and its monumental coffin of murdered Americans, and when he first realized that neither he nor any one was 244 the official representatives of the United States to Spanish Cuba, in short, when Fitzhugh Lee realized that finally the plain people of the United States had, through the reluctant but still obedient government, refused to longer be even officially the friends of the filth, the ignorance and barbarity of Spanish rule in Cuba, Gen. Fitzhugh Lee of Virginia became the happiest man on land or sea, and he said so.      Remember that this soldier and gentleman has seen and has been forced to officially countenance two years of miserable, sordid bloody national crime.      Remember that this proud man has for twenty-four months endured Spanish aggravation and insults on one side and American governmental apathy and shameful pusillanimity on the other, and you can appreciate what I heard the same man whisper to himself when Havana was a thing passed, “At last, thank God!”      This was the vindication and reward of official patience and personal misery, and it is here printed so that the American people may know what their representative has borne from a condition of affairs at their doors which has required martyrdom of 266 sailors to make them understand it and to act.                LEE WOULD RETURN AS AN AVENGER.      Lee earnestly wishes to get back and at them.  He feels to-day in full accord with the college girls’ message to the President.      He said when the Spanish whistling was at its shrillest, fullest volume.      “Wait till we come back.  You’ll all whistle another tune.”      Such remarks show an angry man.  Lee has been [. . .] his every day in Cuba, and his official calm correctness becomes the more remarkable.      Yesterday morning when British Consul-General Gollan and Gen. Lee went to the Palace to officially transfer American interests to the unwilling but commanded Englishman, and when Blanco was said by crafty Congosto to be too ill to receive them, Lee was much relieved.      He feels a personal regard for Spain’s veteran Captain-General and relievedly left Gollan alone.      If the scowls and the malignant glances which were shot at Lee could kill, our Consul-General would be annihilated.      But he just put carelessly his hand in his trousers pocket and carefully upon his revolver and, alone, walked calmly on. 245 GLAD THAT THE SHAM WAS OVER.      It was positively refreshing for him to feel the strain of official courtesy and of official smiles to be over.      In these last trying days great credit must be given to Vice-Consul Springer.  He has worked hard in consular service for over twenty years, and during the last weeks of anxious, excited bombardment of the Havana consulate he has stood the brunt of it.      When he boarded the Fern last night after having himself closed doors and windows, Springer could hardly stand from sheer exhaustion and loss of sleep.      When Havana’s American Consulate changes to an American legation, each of the old employees should be retained, promoted and well paid.      Between handling reconcentrado supplies and feeding American citizens and regular consular business, they have worked and overworked.  They should be rewarded.      Gen. Lee has been deluged the last few days with letters from people ranging from Senators to sweeps. Cables from newspapers all [. . .] curious composition or unique method of proposed killing made them worthy of preservation.      But with the stormy intensity of the Spaniards and their whole [. . .] hate Gen. Lee has for two years been in really great danger.      And he has thought so little of it that few even of the Havana correspondents of American dailies have heard him mention it.      The Olivette will leave by noon with Lee and most of his consular force.  It is understood that to-morrow morning when the party reaches Tampa a special train will be in waiting.
