AMERICANS IN HAVANA ARE NOT IN DANGER.                             ----- Gen. Lee Thinks There Will Be No Rioting Until the First Gun Is Fired or War Declared—Gen. BlancoIs Taking Every Precaution to Preserve Order. -----(Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World, Sent from Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer.) On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Triton, The World, Monday, Friday, April 8, 1898, p. 1                                      Havana Harbor, April 7.      Any reports saying that Havana is turbulent, or that the Volunteers are excited or are drilling, or that recruits are menacing, or that American life is in peril are sensational inventions.      Havana is quiet.  Lee apprehends not the slightest danger until after the first gun or a declaration of war.      Gen. Blanco states that he will vigorously punish rioting.      Gen. Arolas, now in charge of the Havana regulars, is a good officer and understands his business.  He has plenty of troops, and no general attack against Americans seems possible to-day.      The streets are strangely but innocently silent once a year.  No vehicles operate, and now this city, in which there are often a thousand cabs, is queerly quiet.  Out in the bay the Spanish ships all like with yards, booms and guns “cockbilled,” and all flags are at half-mast.      Havana, land and harbor, is officially recognizing Holy Week.      The Mangrove went at 6:30 o’clock to-night without any manifestation of public interest.  She carried a load of refugees.  These are people of the lower class, whom Spaniards hate and educated Spaniards despise.  Yet there was not remark on their going.      No well informed resident here of the many I have seen on the question, thinks any anti-American trouble is at all probably, except as mentioned.
