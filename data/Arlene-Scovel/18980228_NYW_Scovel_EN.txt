SAILOR DEAD NEGLECTED IN FOUL HAVANA BAY.                             -----        Had The World's Offer Been Accepted It Need Not             Have Been Said that After Twelve Days                Only Six Bodies Had Been Saved                      by Our Government.                             -----         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)          The World, Monday, February 28, 1898, p. 1      HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 27.—It  seems incredible that twelve days have gone and that the American Government, with millions in money and men to draw upon, has taken from an iron tomb, from the filthy Havana bay and from total decomposition just six heroic sailors.      All the bodies might have been saved--and recovered in recognizable form--if The World's offer of divers immediately after the catastrophe had been accepted.      During the eight days' work of the navy men and during the three days' work of the navy and professional northern men combined not more than half a dozen bodies have they recovered.                  DIVERS FORCED TO STOP WORK.      There was no investigating to-day.  The navy divers stopped work forward for Sunday.      The steamer Right Arm went to work, but some of her men could not stand the overpowering odors and all quit at 10 o'clock for the day.      Some horribly decomposed bodies were raised yesterday and lay on the small platform where the wrecking crew was working until to-day noon.      If the bodies are not removed promptly the men cannot work.      The chief of the divers has complained to Capt. Sigsbee, who is now on the Fern, and he has promised to give the matter attention.      There was yesterday in the interior of the wreck such a maze of beams, braces and machinery that the divers fell frequently.      There is great danger of their becoming turned about in the inky waters and actually getting lost not fifty feet from the diving platform.      So a systematic plan of ladders is to be used to- morrow.      A diver can explore by sight or touch a strip nine feet wide, then move the ladders, explore another strip, 107 and so on.                   WORST JOB THEY EVER HAD.      The strong, nervy men of the wrecking crew say, "It is the worst job we ever had."      American newspaper correspondents and enterprising artists are sketching everything in sight, and busy snap- shotters abound.      The alert censor stops all information that is technical or telltale. PROOFS POINT ONE WAY.                             -----                   Startling Stories in Cuba               About Knowledge of the Culprits.            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)        The World, Monday, February 28, 1898, pp. 1, 2      HAVANA, Cuba, by way of Key West, Fla., Feb. 27.—The sombre [. . .]proofs one after another and each incontrovertible, have all ended one way.      From the day when the distinguished Court of Inquiry saw this pile of scrap-iron which was once the Maine's bow until to-day the members have grown graver and graver. They realized their immense historical responsibility.      They have personally decided, each one of them, that the proofs show that the Maine was blown up from the outside.      Whether the Governmental demands of the ultra- conservative White House will color their official report is not known, but it is not likely to.      There is not an American naval officer here but thinks the extent, direction and phenomena of the explosion show a torpedo or a mine.               Indications Favor Torpedo Theory.      The mine theory is less tenable.  As cabled from Key West to The World last night, the present indications are that the reserve magazine and a torpedo sent against the port side of the bottom opposite the magazine did the damage.      There is not one chance in one thousand that the Maine destroyed herself.  It seems that her reserve magazine only let its ton of black powder add to the awful havoc wrought by the submarine torpedo or mine--probably, the former.      All experts here unite in this opinion.  Many accusing pieces of twisted iron above water and every shattered bit below are evidences of the truth.      Perhaps never a humanly constructed thing showed the actual effects of applied force as does the Maine.  Naval experts unanimously declare the twisted, battered iron to be so mangled that none but both interior and exterior force applied almost simultaneously could do the work.              Proofs That It Was Not an Accident.      All theories of internal accident drop one by one.      The boilers did not do it, for the only ones with steam on Feb. 15 are in the intact rear part of the wreck. 109      Explosives put into Key West coal did not do it, for all the Key West coal had been used up before the explosion.      Electric wires did not do it, for there was none near the magazines.      Spaniards aboard did not, for the two who were there are dead.      Spontaneous combustion in the coal bunkers did not, for the only ones holding coal that night still hold it untouched.      Gas in the double bottoms did not, for there was nothing there to make it; and, moreover, they were inspected just the week before.                The World Gave the Truth First.      On the other--and the international--hand, The World has printed fact after fact as fast as known.  Not one has shown a purely interior explosive aspect.  Each one has shown the other thing.      No matter how they should have pointed, each has been reported as truthfully as engineering training and some years of experience allowed.      The World has not printed rumors of what A. heard B. say some Spaniard was heard to say.  It was not necessary.      Besides, it was a matter of such terrible gravity that the Naval Court of Inquiry was sitting behind closed doors and in official secrecy as the only body competent to hear a mass of such evidence, which if not conservatively and thoroughly sifted is simply wildly exciting and proves nothing.                     The Stupendous Fact.      But the wreck itself is a stupendous fact.      Its easily identified bottom plates protruding several feet above the water are proofs enough of themselves, even if the censor has to be told a crow story to consent to innocently pass the news of their discovery.      Thousands of startling rumors are current in Cuba circles alleging knowledge of the real culprits.  Those who are willing to swear to them I have sent to the Court of Inquiry. 110              HERE’S BRAVE BILL ANTHONY’S STORY.                             -----  He Tells Sylvester Scovel of the Blowing Up of the Maine.                            -----                 HE STOOD AT SIGSBEE’S DOOR.                            -----                When the Captain Came out the               Marine Told Him of the Disaster                      With Perfect Calm.                            -----                 OFFICERS’ BEARING ADMIRABLE.                            -----          Capt. Sigsbee Said, “Go First, Gentlemen,”              And Anthony Was the Last to Leave.                            -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)          The World, Monday, February 28, 1898, p. 3      HAVANA, via Key West, Feb. 27.—Here is brave Bill Anthony’s own story of the wreck of the Maine.      I asked him: “What did you feel first the night of the explosion?”      He laid his big sinewy hand, palm down, flat upon the red mess table.      “Now, see here,” said he, “the back of my hand may be the ship’s deck and this is what I first felt.”      The little forecastle of Capt. Cowles’s United States steamer Fern was bright and clean from the deck up.  Bill could conveniently make use of a brass band tublet half full of sawdust.      It was shining bright, and so were the faces of the watch below, and all hands off duty.  They had gathered in the “fo’castle” to hear the story of the wreck told all at once by a comrade.      They listened intently to brave Bill Anthony, and from their silence and the comparatively few shots made at the tub you knew their moving jaws were but mechanical rolling their quids and that perhaps for the first time in naval history a marine was being admired to the [f]ullest by Jack tars.      Bill spasmodically contracted and extended his long fingers.  The back of his hand rose and fell and twisted. He vibrated his wrist the meanwhile.  The motion was also a shuddering one.      “Now,” said Bill, “that’s what I felt first.  That’s how the Maine’s deck planking moved for ten seconds, I 111 guess, and then came the end.  It wasn’t a sharp sound.  It didn’t seem like one of the big guns a-going.  It was a horrible long dash of everything out and out and up.”      Anthony half rose as he finished his slowly uttered words.  He felt it again a bit, and so did the sailors.                     Like a Volcanic Heave      “What can I liken it to?”  Anthony thought.  He has read a bit and has been with the Mediterranean squadron.      “Well, I guess if some of them Pompeilans had been standing on that volcano and she went up sudden with them when their town was buried they’d have felt just like us fellows on the Maine.”  He continued:      “It was just one terrible roar, and the light and that and the going up of everything just paralyzed me for a minute.  The electric lights went out, of course, and it was black as a coal-passer a-coming off watch.      “My post was at the door of the Captain’s cabin.  It was pitch dark, but I remember when I started into the passage to the Captain’s cabin that the deck was canted to port and I went down hill like a barrel a-rolling down the Capitol steps and fetched up against Capt. Sigsbee, who was coming out.      “We met just where the entry makes a turn, right where the old man had them pet cloud pictures hung up.  I would not a bumped him so hard if I’d known, but I begged his pardon.”      Here Bill stopped to smile a bit.      Capt. Sigsbee was very proud of his cloud pictures. When he was chief of the Hydrographic office he contrived and executed the idea of a set of pictures for ships’ officers showing the various forms of clouds in all latitudes with the weather significance in each.      “What did I say to the Captain?  Well, I just told him what had happened.”      What Marine Orderly Anthony did say, according to Capt. Sigsbee, were these words which should be carved in monumental stone:      “Sir, I have to inform you that the ship has been blown up and is sinking.”      It was the epitome of a combined perfection in valor and in discipline.  That cool, calm, terse, regular-order- of things sentence was wonderful.      Even with his splendid ship sinking like a shot and his splendid crew smothering in their hammocks and the air yet rent by explosion, fire, flying iron, beams, boats and bodies, Capt. Sigsbee was struck by Anthony’s sentence and remembered it afterward. 112      “What did the Captain say?”                   Could Not Quote Sigsbee. Anthony clinched his big fist and looked grim. Then he remembered discipline as ever and said: “You know, Mr. Reporter, we’ve orders not to say anything which might have a bearing on why she blew up. I can’t tell you what the Captain said.” Here I can help Anthony out. I do not know what the captain said then, but I do know what he said to me twenty minutes later when he stood on the City of Washington amid the groans of wounded men, and for the first time realized part of the awful loss of life. I say upon my own responsibility that the moment Sigsbee saw the peculiar effect of the explosion—when he got one good look at the blazing wreck—he knew the truth. He knew the Maine had been blown up from some primary outside cause, and there has not been found one huddled beam or bolt or gun or powder case to change his mind. “As we came out upon deck,” continued Bill, “We saw officers tumbling up the wardroom ladder. She was going down very fast. We all knew she was gone altogether. Captain and I climbed on to the top of the superstructure, which is the roof of his cabin. We used the wardroom hatch combing and an iron shutter that had been blown open. “The captain looked about. Wreckage had ceased falling, and he could see the big piece of main deck thrown up forward of midship like a mountain. That hid the bow, but he could feel that was gone. “I didn’t hear any but a few muffled cries at the very first, but now the yells for help came from the water all around the ship. They seemed far away. I guess my ears must have been stunned by the first roar. “The officers had gained the poop along with us, and when the Captain had taken one look about he said, ‘save the men.’ The gig was hanging on the starboard quarter and the light barge—the one you remember that the Dutchmen would not row against—was on the port quarter. A fellow named Sophis had been blown clean from the middle superstructure, where he was sleeping over into the wreckage about the poop. We hauled him up on it, and there were the men who had been doing extra duty there for some petty offense.                   Were Saved by Punishment.      “One of ‘em is Niblo.  He’s got a wife and family, and says he’s going to thank the captain first time he sees him for having punished him.  It saved his life.      “Everybody jumped, officers and men together, at the                              113 old man’s order.  You know it ain’t disrespectful to call him that.  He’s a brick.  But they call all captains ‘the old man.’      “We got the boats into the water pretty quick.  We didn’t have far to lower them.  In fact, a minute later, when the captain stepped into his gig, her ‘gunnel’ was just up with the one dry spot on the port and aft corner of the superstructure of the deck.      “The Spanish boats came by the run; yes, they were prompter than I ever saw ‘em in all my life before, and the Ward liner got hers into the water quicker than any merchantman ever worked before.      “Sigsbee was standing quiet.  He was the coolest man I ever saw.  He was just as quiet as the day we bumped the dock in New York to save the lives on that excursion steamer.  The old man thought his ship would be a wreck that day, but she wasn’t.  It took tons of powder to break her when she did go.      “I offered captain my cap, but he wouldn’t take it. The boats picked up all the men and orders were given to leave the ship.  There was Lieutenant-Commander Wainwright, Navigating Officer Holman and Hood and Blandin and the others.      “Captain said, ‘Go first, gentlemen.’  They all bowed as polite as if they were at an Annapolis hop, and Sigsbee made ‘em go first, although they kicked.      “But I followed the captain, I was the last man off. It was a terrible sight to see the old Maine when we got a little off and could see her plain.”                    Pride Kept Back Groans.      “She was all gone forward, and the Spanish boats and the Washington and tugs were full of groaning men with their skins and flesh burnt off.  But they kept mighty still just the same.  They wouldn’t let the Dagos hear’ em whimper, but none of us thought so many had been killed. It was hard to think then that two minutes had killed a whole crew.”      “What do you think about the splendid state funeral, Anthony?”  I asked.  “You know you’re not officially bound to keep quiet about that.”      “You bet I’m not.” said Anthony, “I’m an American and can say what I think.  I say it was a downright shame to parade these poor bodies through the streets.  I saw some women crying, but they’re apt to do that anyhow.      “All the Dagos looked happy, and I wanted to smash their faces.  Why, there wasn’t a single American flag on a coffin or under it, either.  The whole thing was red and 114 yellow.  I don’t see how it was allowed, but I suppose them that managed it knows best.”      There had been several of the Fern’s crew ashore and they growled out a hearty chorus of Amens to Anthony’s remarks.  Anthony continued:      “All our men hated this job.  From the time we entered the harbor no one liked it.  There was no complaining, but the fellows who knew most about torpedoes was kept busy answering questions.”      Anthony is reticent about himself, but questioning developed the fact that he has been a regular-army man before he became, according to Kipling, “Soldier and sailor, too.”      Born in Albany, N.Y., in 1847, he entered the army in 1869.  He made the round of Western forts and saw Indian fighting.      He was discharged in 1884 and studied for the civil service, but got tired after eight months’ waiting and joined the marine corps.  His civil appointment did arrive, but just too late.  He left the marine corps in ’89 to go to his first love and be a buck soldier again, and once more, in ’93 he entered the navy for good, unless his Maine experience has taught him the beauties of solid earth.  He is a private.  He should be promoted and forever held up as an example of coolness and quickness in the face of awful danger.      Anthony is tall, very well set up, has a fine strong nose, sweeping mustache and is the beau ideal of a non- commissioned officer.      He is a private.  He should be promoted and forever held up as an example of coolness and quickness in the face of awful danger. 115
