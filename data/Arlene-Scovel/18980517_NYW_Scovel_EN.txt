THRALL AND JONES TO BE EXCHANGED.                             -----           These Two World Men Entered Cuba on Their             Own Responsibility, and Were Captured                      By Spanish Cavalry.                             -----                    BUT BLANCO WAS GENEROUS                 AND WILL SOON SET THEM FREE.                             -----          Story of the Negotiations in Havana Harbor,          Under a Flag of Truce, for Their Exchange.                             -----                    (Special to The World.)          The World, Tuesday, May 17, 1898.  pp. 1, 2      KEY WEST, Fla., May 16.—The first Americans made prisoners by the Spaniards during this war were Charles H. Thrall, The World’s Cuban correspondent, and Haydon Jones, The World’s war artist, who are now in grim old Cabanas. These intrepid men, zealous in their patriotism, entered upon this expedition on their personal responsibility, thoroughly aware of the risks they were bound to encounter.      They were captured on Cuban soil after they were seen landing from The World’s despatch boat Triton.  Had they been hanged as spies the ethics of war would have justified the Spaniards.      But the men were treated with kindness, consideration and courtesy.  Within forty-eight hours they will be free men aboard a United States war vessel.  Captain-General Blanco has agreed to exchange them for two Spanish officers.      On learning of their capture The World set about speedily and with great energy to save them.  The Government in Washington and the naval officials did all within their power.  Captain-General Blanco and the officers under him have been most humane and generous.      When the news reached me that Thrall and Jones had been captured I sent a cable message to a Spanish colonel who is a member of the Cortes and to Mendez, the Government censor in Havana, asking for full particulars.  When I returned this morning I found the reply awaiting me.  Here is a translation:                   SENOR MENDEZ’S COURTESY.                                             “Havana, May 15.      “The correspondents were yesterday captured by our “Scovel, Key West: 296 forces.  They were attempting to disembark, as is always impossible.  Salvador Jones and Charles H. Thrall were saved.  They say they are your companions.  They have been treated with the generosity which, you know, is habitual with us.  They are in a fortress, where they are treated with distinction.      “Do you remember my advice?  What a mistake you have made and how foolishly you have acted!  It is said that you escaped by swimming.  Is this the truth?      “When will your real fighters come?  Hurry up the campaign.  Oh, let it come quickly!  Here we are very tranquil, and assured of giving you a disagreeable surprise.  We’ll see what comes of it.      “I take much pleasure in giving you the facts you ask, doing so with the smile that is habitual with me.                                      “RAMON MENDEZ, Censor.”      The advice to which Mendez refers was a friendly word to me not to return to Cuba.      It was just ninety-six hours ago that Thrall and Jones were landed.  The Triton had taken a swing around westward and then stood in toward Havana, as if coming up the coast from Mariel.  Approaching Banes Cove, fifteen miles west of Havana, we saw the ancient stone blockhouse swarming with Spanish soldiers.  Three miles further east projected a small coral point which appeared to offer an admirable landing place. We searched the land with our glasses. We could see no sign of soldiers in the stately palm orchards. No one shot at us. The Triton’s battered lifeboat was lowered for landing. Thrall, Jones and myself jumped into the stern. I had a navy rifle. On landing the two men started alongshore, under cover of the dense vegetation. It was Thrall’s purpose to strike inland about half a mile from where we landed. We saw the two disappear into the jungle as the boat was hoisted on to the Triton.      The Spaniards no doubt saw the Triton draw close to the shore.  Possibly they saw the men leave the boat.  A detachment of cavalry was sent after them.  The troopers came upon The World’s men about a mile from shore.  There was no chance of escape.                    AMERICAN DIPLOMACY WON.      Thrall speaks Spanish as he does English, and he knows the Spanish character.  He frankly acknowledged that he and Jones were World correspondents, and threw himself upon the generosity of the lieutenant in charge, relying upon the vanity and weakness of his captors.      His diplomacy succeeded.  He and Jones were treated 297 with courtesy and consideration.      The next morning they were taken to Havana.  They were cross-examined at the palace and then sent over to Cabanas Fortress.      The news was cabled to Madrid and from there cabled to The World.  The names had been misspelled, but they did not conceal their identity.      When Commodore Remy learned that The World’s men had been captured he cabled to Secretary Long, saying that if arrangements for exchange were made immediately their lives could be saved.      Commodore Remy’s despatches probably reached Washington about the same time that those from The World arrived—about 4.30 P. M.  Within an hour and a half the answer was flashed back to Commodore Remy.  It said, in effect:      “Send warship under flag of truce immediately to Havana, with Mr. Knight on board.  Have officer in command negotiate with Gen. Blanco for prisoners.”      Knight is the London Times correspondent.  He wished to go to Havana, having received permission from Gen. Blanco to remain there, and he was anxious to do his utmost, with Mr. Gullon, the British Consul General, to save the prisoners.      Lieut. Brainard was detailed to open the first negotiations with the Spaniards since the war began.  He was to carry the first flag of truce, and his mission was to save the lives of two World men.      The armed tug Uncas was almost ready to steam to her station on the blockade when Lieut. Brainard and his crew went aboard.  It was just sixty-four hours after the landing in Cuba and twelve hours after The World received the first news of the capture that the Uncas started for Havana.  I stowed away.  I thought they might need an interpreter.  I didn’t come forth from my hiding place until the Uncas had left Sand Key light astern.  Brainard could not turn back, and he couldn’t very well throw me overboard.                EMPOWERED TO TREAT WITH BLANCO.      Brainard had sealed orders for the senior officer of the Havana station, Capt. McKenzie, of the Mayflower.  The Uncas paused beside the yacht that had been converted into a warship about noon yesterday.  The lieutenant went aboard and stayed about five minutes.  He returned with power to treat with Gen. Blanco for the exchange of any two Spanish officers now prisoners of war for Thrall and Jones.      “Turn her nose for Havana and rig up one of my sheets 298 for a flag,” he commanded.      There was mutiny at once.  Quartermaster Kelly was ordered to hoist the sheet.      “I’ll not hoist a white flag, sir,” said Kelly, with a deal of respect and more determination.      “Hoist that flag of truce,” commanded Brainard sternly, but there was a glint in his eye that belied his sharp command.      “I’ll not do it, sir,” said Kelly, with equal firmness.  And he held out his hands as if he expected the irons to be placed on them.  “I’ll be—if I do it,” he added under his breath.      Brainard turned away.  Another man hauled the white sheet to the foretop, and the Uncas sped toward the harbor at top speed.      Powerful telescopes showed companies of soldiers working like ants on Morro’s eastern batteries and brought the big guns uncomfortably close.      Presently spots of color fluttered from Morro’s signal mast.  They could not be read.  Then they were lowered, and we set signals which read: “I wish to communicate with you.”      An answer was raised from the fortress:  “Await orders.”      The engines were stopped and the Uncas rolled in the seaway.  Through the glasses we could see the gunners beside the big cannon. We waited for an hour and a half before we saw a grayish speck develop into the little fourth-class gunboat Flecha, with a white tablecloth floating from her stem. Meanwhile the Uncas had drifted about two miles from shore. The Flecha rounded to about a mile away, broad-side on as if inviting the Uncas further in. Probably she didn’t like the looks of the Mayflower and Vicksburg, who were about two miles seaward.      We ran toward the batteries again.      “Come close,” hailed the Spaniard.      It was Lieut. Ro[. . .] y Lopez, of the Admiral’s staff who spoke.  He speaks English.      “I’ll come alongside in my small boat,” answered Brainard, and at once stepped into it, followed by Knight.      A few minutes later Brainard and Knight stepped on to the Flecha. The American officer shook hands in a hearty fashion, while Knight preserved his British conventionality. The Spaniards were punctiliously polite.      Brainard and Knight went below and the speedy gunboat rounded Morro’s rocky point, stopping just outside the 299 mines in Havana harbor.  The docks and quays were jammed with people.      The Admiral’s launch came up and Brainard and Knight were invited on deck to meet Gen. Blanco’s representative, a Colonel of Infantry.  Brainard explained his mission and Knight showed his credentials.      Mr. Gollan, the British Consul-General, came on board and said that Thrall and Jones were safe.      The colonel of the infantry departed with Brainard’s despatch.  Within half an hour he returned with Gen. Blanco’s compliments saying that Thrall and Jones would be willingly exchanged the moment that Gen. Blanco had received by cable, through Consul-General Gollan, the formal notification from the American Government that Spanish officers held prisoner were sent in their place. The ship that brought the Spanish officers to Havana would convey the Americans to Key West.      Knight prepared to land, but the Spanish officers and Consul Gollan dissuaded him, saying that the police and soldiers could not protect him from the mob.  Knight thereupon decided to come back and take another opportunity for landing in Havana. Matters having been thus satisfactorily arranged, Brainard and Knight retired to the Uncas, which then headed for the Mayflower, and Brainard reported to Capt. McKenzie, and subsequently they returned to Key West.      Brainard is now in communication with Commodore Remy. If the Spanish prisoners are started south from Atlanta to- day there is no reason why Thrall and Jones should not be free men by Wednesday.
