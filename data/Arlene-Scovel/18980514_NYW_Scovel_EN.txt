The Gussie, with the Manning and Wasp, has approached the shore to land supplies for the Cubans under Baldomero, Acosta and Delgado.      The shelling began at 9 A. M. by batteries on a ridge three-quarters of mile inland.  It was sharp work.  The first two shells narrowly missed the transport.  The Manning and the Wasp answered and silenced both batteries after a half hour’s raid firing.  The Manning’s crew was new to the guns.  The Wasp’s shooting was excellent.  There were no casualties on either side.  Spanish total, if any, is unknown.      The American troops fought their first fight on Cuban soil three days ago, and they won.      There were not many of them landed from the transport Gussie for the initial conflict, but they went into the fight with a will and there was no question as to the result.      This is the first encounter of American troops with a foreign force on its own ground in many a year, and it proves conclusively their bravery.  The Spanish war is now on both by land and sea.  The landing party that stood on Cuban soil this morning shot to kill, and it shot well. The Spaniards left three of their dead behind them, which is unusual, and shows the haste with which they were compelled to abandon the position they had occupied.      The Americans lost not a man and not one of the 289 landing force was seriously wounded.  In its little way this attack upon the Spanish was as completely successful as Commodore Dewey’s assault upon Manila.      The best proof of the good showing made by the bluecoats is the fact that they were taken utterly by surprise, but stood their ground like veterans although many of them were smelling powder for the first time in their lives.      The fight occurred on the shore of the harbor of Cabanas.  It has been arranged to send couriers to the Cuban leaders to convey plans proposed by the American generals.  It was most important that the despatches should reach their destination, and a special force was selected to protect the couriers until they were placed in safety on Cuban soil.      It was known before starting from Key West that the whole north coast of Cuba was dotted with the Spanish forces.  In small companies they could be found anywhere, and it was possible for them to concentrate a large force at short notice.  From the city of Havana to Cabanas, in the province of Pinar del Rio, there is not a stone ruin or cave that is not the rendezvous of from two to three hundred of the Spanish infantry.  The shore line is guarded from end to end, and it is almost an impossibility for a vessel to approach the coast without being discovered.      The landing of couriers or small forces, or even considerable amounts of ammunition, can therefore best be done at night.      Such was the plan of Capt. Dorst, who was in command of the present expedition.  He is commander of Company E. of the First United States infantry, and he had his own men with him. The couriers and troops were carried by the transport Gussie. This is a venerable side-wheeler of Mississippi River glory. She did not reach Key West until 5 P.M. yesterday, although it had been expected she would get there much sooner, and Capt. Dorst had arranged to leave Key West not later than 6 P.M.      There were other mistakes in the arrangements, and it was 9 P. M. before a start was finally made.           THE WORLD’S TUG TRITON IN THE EXPEDITION.      The fine armed revenue cutter Manning led the expedition. She went ahead with only her stern light showing, for the guidance of the Gussie, which was towed out of the harbor by The World’s despatch-boat Triton.      Not another vessel was near and not another was permitted by the regulations to leave the harbor.  It was 290 all done in the quiet and darkness of night.      The troops on the Gussie were exceedingly happy.  They were thoroughly tired of railroading across the continent and the doleful camping at Tampa.  To their minds any change was acceptable.  These bluecoats are all Westerners, and they chafe under the restraint of camp life.  They were glad they had been given the honor of engaging in the dangerous expedition.      But it was not happy weather.  In less than an hour after the start had been made the rain began to fall.  It came down in sheets and it was impossible to see more than a cable’s length ahead.  The Manning disappeared in the darkness and Capt. Dorst hailed the Triton to carry to the Manning the announcement of a change in the plans that had been made necessary by the delay at Key West.      The Manning’s stern light could not be seen, and it was impossible to do anything but steam back to the Gussie and her anxious commander.  He heard the word and the answer came ringing back.      All right.  Take your course.  We’ll go ahead on ours.”      It was 9:30 A.M. when the north coast of Cuba was reached. The Manning was now again sighted, having laid to in wait for her convoy. She steamed to a position abeam of the Gussie, and then they turned westward toward the port of Cabanas, with the Triton in close company. The lookouts on the Triton were the first to sight Spanish troops on the shore, and the information was promptly conveyed to the Manning. Her crew went to quarters with the agility of acrobats.      The captain of the Manning was patient.  The guns were shotted, but there were no orders to fire, although there could be plainly seen the head of a Spanish column emerging upon a yellow road leading from the brush down to the beach.      The gunners waited.  The captain could not be sure whether the soldiery were hostile Spanish or friendly Cubans.  The vessels drew nearer the shore, and then it was easy to distinguish the light blue uniforms and straw hats that mark the Spaniards from the Cubans in their mud- colored dress. Still it was not time for shooting, and the Manning forged ahead. The captain remarked that he would shell that force on the return trip, and it is probable that it has felt the weight of American projectiles long before this has reached the readers of The World. 291      It was 11 A. M. when the Manning and Gussie passed Mariel, the head of Weyler’s famous trocha.  Just west of this harbor the coast hills rise high, and it was easy with glasses to distinguish bodies of cavalry moving along their edge.            WARSHIPS OPEN FIRE ON SPANISH CAVALRY.      Twenty minutes later the Gussie slowed up off a strip of sand that seemed a likely place to put the couriers ashore and send their horses swimming after them.  The Gussie and Manning steamed in toward the shore.      In plain sight were four Spanish cavalry scouts and the guns were trained on them.  There was a discharge, and the scouts hurried back into the bush.  They were armed with Mauser rifles and the ships were well within their range, but the Spanish aim was bad, and no bloodshed followed their fire.  It was the first small-arm episode of the present war, and it [. . .] a tiny prelude to the heavier skirmish that was soon to follow.      Those on board the Gussie had made preparations for disembarking and these were stopped as soon as the firing began.  The Cuban couriers had no desire to land in a nest of their enemies and Capt. Dorst agreed they were right.      He gave orders for further steaming westward and no stop was then made until Punta Fria, the harbor entrance of Cabanas, was reached.  This was the landing-place that had been first selected.      It was about 1 P.M. when the lookouts sighted a large, stone-walled, roofless sugar mill that was seen to be jammed and fringed by the inevitable men in the blue cloth and straw hats.      The captain of the Manning signalled.      “Shall I shell them?”      Capt. Dorst responded:      “With pleasure.”      The gun crews on the Manning had been at quarters for nearly three hours and they were restless.  In fact, they have not had their guns very long and they wanted a chance to use them.      Their first shots were unsteady and apparently did no damage.  There were no dust jets from the stone masonry, but it was seen that the Spanish troops deemed it best to evacuate.      When Punta Fria was reached, the veteran Cuban coast pilot Blanco cautiously dropped the unwieldy Gussie inshore until she lay 300 yards from the beach.  The brush back of the sand was so dense that it was impossible to find an opening in it with glasses.  In front of the beach there 292 was a coral reef with long rollers breaking over it.      The Gussie’s anchor was dropped overboard and it seemed to be the signal for firing from the shore. From the eastern end of the harbor entrance, possibly 2,000 yards away, there came a heavy rifle fire. The weapons again were Mausers and the ships were within range, but not a bullet struck the Gussie. Occasionally there were heavier discharges, as if from the old-style guns, but it was impossible to make out any forces.      One of the Gussie’s long-boats was lowered, no one paying any attention to the firing.  Six soldier oarsmen and a soldier coxswain made the crew.      No one knows where these California fighters learned to row, but they do it well.       FIRST LANDING ON CUBA OF UNITED STATES REGULARS.      Capt. Dorst was short of boats, and he requested the Triton to help putting the couriers on shore.  There were two of them with a guide.  Capt. Donator Soto, who was formerly with Maceo, is in charge of the expedition and with him is his secretary, Antonio Maria Canas.  Their guide is Padron.  They carry the latest official’s news of the war and instructions for the future to Gen. Pedro Diaz, who commands the insurgent forces in the province of Pinar del Rio.      There were hushed moments while the boats were tumbling through the surf to the shore.  On the deck of the Gussie were men with ready rifles pointed to the brush back of the beach.  Capt. Pfister stood ready to command them to fire.  Lieut. Tracy was half way up the shrouds, peering down upon the tangled undergrowth.  But not a Spaniard was to be seen.      The long boats reached the shore and the couriers jumped out upon the beach.  The bluecoats followed them, the first men to land on the first fighting day between American and Spanish soldiers.      About a hundred yards down the beach there was a small clump of trees back of which the brush was very dense.  It looked to be a good lurking place for expectant Spanish soldiers, and it was.  They were in safe ambush and watched the Americans land.      A second boatload started from the Gussie and quickly made the beach.  In all there were twenty American soldiers on Cuban ground.  Some of the men started forward to beat the bush in true Indian fashion.      They had scarcely reached the jungle when there came the sharp crack of Mausers, followed by the quick whistling of bullets. 293      It was just 2.50 P. M. and the fight was on.  The men on the Gussie poured a steady fire into the trees and shrubbery.  The Spanish fire became hotter, but none the less wild.  Bullets whistled everywhere.  Those on the Gussie thought there must be a whole column of Spaniards in the ambush.      The Americans who had gone forward to scout could not be seen.  In five minutes they came tumbling back upon the beach.  The firing was incessant.      Capt. Dorst tried to signal for the Manning and the auxiliary yacht Wasp to come and shell the Spanish position, but there was a delay.  The men on the beach kept up their fire, although it looked as if they were opposed by at least 400.      Finally the Manning got into range and opened fire. At first her shells burst half a mile beyond the Spanish position, but this was soon corrected and the deadly projectiles struck where they were directed.      Capt. Pfister’s marksmen on the deck of the Gussie shot magnificently, and in less than ten minutes the Spanish fire ceased.  They had been driven from their stronghold.      The men on the shore under command of Capt. O’Connell had meantime been having a hot time, notwithstanding the protection they received from the fire from the ship.  The captain had placed his men well.  About fifty yards inland from the point where the second boatload landed lived a fisherman.  He was also a charcoal burner, and in a small clearing in front of his cabin had completed an excavation for a new kiln.      It made a splendid rifle pit, and Capt. O’Connell posted most of his men there.  Their steady fire did much toward driving the Spaniards from their position.      When the enemy’s firing ceased scouts were sent forward to make sure that the Spaniards had retired.  It was discovered that they had moved further inland toward their blockhouses.      The dead they left behind were a lieutenant and two privates.      Capt. Dorst ordered a recall and went ashore in person to superintend the re-embarkation.              COURIERS OFF WITH ORDERS FOR GOMEZ.      The couriers mounted, shook hands and galloped down the beach on their perilous journey to the Gobernado Hills. They had borne themselves well in the encounter.      It was now 5 P.M.  The bluecoats were thoroughly tired.  They had fought and scrambled through the jungle 294 and all were wet by landing in the surf.  They were glad to get back to the ship. The only man wounded was James F. Archibald. He is correspondent of the San Francisco Post. He was struck in the left arm, but the wound was not dangerous.      Capt. O’Connell speaks most highly of his bravery, for although hit, Archibald worked right through the fight as messenger or soldier, as was needed.  He wears the regulation uniform and carries a rifle.  The members of Company E are fond of him, and Capt. Dorst mentions his wound in his official report.      The men under fire were all from Company E.  They were in two squads while entering the jungle.  Capt. O’Connell led one of fourteen men.  With him were Lieut. Nolan, Sergt. Rush, Sergt. Linterbrandt, Sergt. Salter, Fighting Correspondent Archibald, Corpl. P. O’Brien and among the privates were Charles Nolan, James Nolan, Stingley and Ammon.      Lieut. Crofton commanded the other party of eight men. He had Corpl. Eagen and privates Powell, Zuckerman, Olsen, Rudolph, Daily, Jabelman and Doyle.  These squads were later mixed in the rifle pit.      One of their members called out:      “Don’t you forget to say that E. Company fired the first shot in Cuba.”  J. Ralph Paine, The World correspondent, lay in the pit alongside a strapping frontier soldier and answered:      “You bet we won’t.”      One prisoner was taken.  He was the fisherman, and the Cubans vehemently accused him of having notified the Spanish of the American arrival.  It is not likely, however, that Capt. Dorst will treat him severely.
