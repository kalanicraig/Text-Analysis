The members are satisfied that it did not explode:      From the first glance everything has pointed that way.      It is known now that the divers found the floor of the big forward starboard magazine containing twenty-five tons of powder, intact, while the sides were not completely destroyed or burned.      It is an absolute physical impossibility that a part of its one hundred and eighty cylinders, filled with powder, should not have exploded. And it is just as awfully true that no explosives in the waist or forward part of the ship could, under the proved circumstances have so mangled and blown away and broken in two the battle-ship Maine. Something else must 101 have done it.      Naval experts say a big torpedo placed under the port side off the bottom just next to the reserve magazine would easily have caused the actual havoc if it were assisted by the 2,000 pounds of quick burning saluting powder known to have been in the reserve magazine. It is not likely that mines exist inside of the closed Havana harbor and not likely that, if near the Government buoy, a mine would be placed in the position most seldom occupied by a ship anchored to the buoy as the Maine.      It is most likely that if such a mine had been built it would have been badly out of order, like most Spanish naval affairs, if indeed it had ever contained explosives for which the Spanish government paid.               POSITIVE PROOF OF A BOTTOM PLATE.      As was obscurely cabled to The World last night, one of the Maine's bottom plates has been blown from left to right and upward.      Originally it was under water on the port side about opposite the forward turret.      It now protrudes four feet out of the water fifteen feet inside the proper line of contour of the vessel, as is shown by the undamaged rear two thirds.      The Maine's bottom plates were painted, I am informed, with McGuinnis's green anti-fouling paint.      This plate is thus painted on its port side.  On its other side it is plastered with the cement only used in the Maine on the inside of the bottom plates.  The cement is gathered thick in the corners of the angle irons on the starboard side of the plate.                     CUMULATIVE EVIDENCE.      This would be sufficient proof even without the divers' magazine discovery;      Or the ten-inch shells thrown toward the starboard;      Or the main deck being doubled back to starboard and port;      Or the living men who slept near the big magazine;      Or the dead bodies near it unmangled;      Or the forward funnel thrown to right and rear;      Or the cement hurled aboard the Washington;      Or any other of the many proofs already cabled to The World.Any one was indicative, all together are stunningly convincing.      The forward magazine did not explode--which alone of all the explosive places aboard could do the damage.      And a torpedo or a mine under the port side of the 102 Maine's bottom did explode--as is shown by half a dozen witnesses, who testify to hearing a double report.  And that, with the assistance of the saluting powder, blew up the Maine and killed her crew. Who did it? DIVERS' EVIDENCE CONVINCED THE COURT.         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)       The World. Saturday, February 26, 1898, pp. 1, 2                                       HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 25. The Naval Court of Inquiry is completely satisfied now by the evidence of the divers in regard to the origin of the explosion which destroyed the Maine.      The divers went down into the wreck this morning again and got evidence to confirm the suspicions aroused by the findings of day before yesterday.      The court may not leave for Key West for a day or two, as it has found many more witnesses to examine.      Hitherto the navy divers have been at work for the purposes of the investigation.              WRECKERS WILL BE BUSY FROM NOW ON.      From now on the wrecking steamer Right Arm will proceed vigorously with her task.  Her divers were busy to- day down forward.      It is expected that all the remaining bodies will be recovered within three days.      Lieutenant Commander Wainwright has charge of the work.      Gunner Charles Morgan, the bright warrant officer of the cruiser New York, probably will directly overlook the divers.      Chief Gunner’s Mate Olsen of the battle-ship Iowa, is doing splendid work.  The officers say they never have seen a better diver than he. NO HOPE OF FINDING JENKINS AND MERRITT.The divers attached to the Right Arm have abandoned all hope of recovering the bodies of Jenkins and Merritt. The conclusion has been reached that they were giving orders to the sailors and were drowned and disappeared.      The ship’s safe was secured and brought on board the Right Arm to-day.  It contained about $25,000.  It will be opened to-morrow.      The divers also saved the valuable chalices from Chaplain Chidwick’s room.      Senor Peral, of the Spanish Board of Inquiry into the cause of the Maine disaster, dined Engineer Graham and Mr. Roundtree, of the English-built floating dry dock, to-night at the Hotel Inglaterra.                      NO HOPE FOR HOLZER. 104 Poor Holzer, who is still alive, has not even a fighting chance.  He was the man who, dying and in horrible agony, said to Capt. Sigsbee: "Captain, I am sorry I can't shake hands with you."  (His hands were swathed in bandages.)  "I am sorry you've lost your ship and your comrades."      He ought to have a monument. 105
