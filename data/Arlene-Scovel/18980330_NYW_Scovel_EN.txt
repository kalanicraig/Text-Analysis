HAVANA TAKES NEWS OF THE MAINE REPORT QUIETLY.                             -----        La Lucha, However, Attacks Its Conclusions, and        Insinuates Lack of Discipline--Two More Bodies           Recovered, As Well As Four Six-Inch Guns.    (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World.  Sent   from Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer.) On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Triton, The World, Wednesday, March 30, 1898, p. 7                                     Havana Harbor, March 29.      Havana received the news to-day very quietly.  All the newspapers stated that the Board of Inquiry found proofs that the Maine was blown up by a mine under the port side.      There was very little comment upon this point, but much writing over the statement that "the commission is unable to form a concrete idea of the form of the casualty from the divers’ testimony."      They say that if the board has no idea of affairs how can it know that a mine was exploded.      La Lucha bitterly attacks the report and repeats all the stock insinuations of the Maine's officers all dining aboard the City of Washington on the night of the disaster; that the torpedoes had war heads on; that the Maine's cannon were loaded; that there had been two mutinies among the sailors over refusals to grant them shore leave; that an officer had said he was disgusted with the United States Navy and wished that all the ships might sink anyhow; that the crew were so paralyzed on the night of the explosion that they refused to lower the boats, this proved by finding some boats fast to their davits--in short, that there was so much carelessness aboard the Maine no wonder she blew up.      Spanish divers worked again to-day for about two hours.  They were laboring on the starboard side near the protruding plates.      Two more bodies were recovered to-day.  They were clothed and can probably be identified.  It is regarded as simply marvelous how well preserved are the bodies even after this lapse of forty-five days under the filthy waters.      All the navy divers have now departed.  The wreckers are working well and have already secured four valuable 215 six-inch guns and are now after the two bow ones.  They think Capt. Chidwick has reported the inadvisability of further work after the machinery without explosives.      All candidates were elected according to slate.  The election went through as smoothly as in smaller New York's smoothest Tammany ward.  There wasn't an objection.
