GEN. SHAFTER MAY CAPTURE SANTIAGO JULY 4.                             -----        Gen. Toral, in Command of Spanish Forces, Says               the Americans Will Be Defeated—He                      Has 30,000 Troops.                             -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)             The World, Friday, July 1, 1898, p. 1      SIBONEY, OUTPOST AT HICUCOS, June 29, via Port Antonio, June 30.—Gen. Shafter may make July 1898, as memorable as the same day during the civil war, when Gettysburg and Vicksburg were won.  The battle of Santiago may be fought next Monday.  There is little doubt as to the result.  But the Spaniards will fight [. . .] they have a courage akin to fanaticism.  Gen. Toral, one of the commanders at Santiago, is reported as having said:      “The Americans cannot force entrance into Santiago. The entrenchments are too strong.”      He said this to Eusebio [. . .], one of his intimates, like himself a native of the Canary Islands.  Young Luis Mendoza, Eusebio’s son, for whose reliability some of the [. . .] conservative Cubans have personally vouched to me, heard the remark and repeated it here to-day, having run through the Spanish picket lines.      Young Mendoza brings details and plans of the Spanish positions.  The extreme Spanish outposts run [. . .] the point where the Caney road leaves Santiago on the south, along the harbor bluffs in a circular line to Morro.  The entrenchments curve about the city into the high hills, stopping at El Cobre, six miles to the northwest where the water system begins.      There are no defenses on the western side, the mountains constituting what the Spaniards consider the natural fortifications.      Mendoza says that none of Cervera’s rapid-fire guns has been landed except four small pieces.  The artillery in the entrenchments consists of a few mountain howitzers and half a dozen muzzle-loading bronze cannon.      This weakness in artillery was confirmed to-day by Cuban scouts.  It shows that there is no need of seige guns on our side.  Major Dillenback with his brigade of light batteries can do the work.      According to Mendoza food conditions in Santiago are fast approaching a crisis.  Horse meat is now exhausted. The soldiers are subsisting on rice and cornmeal, of which 327 they get quarter rations.  The people are eating mangoes as a steady diet.  Prices of food articles have gone up to fabulous figures.  Shelled corn is $20 a barrel, and rice 35 cents a pound.  There is no pork.  All vegetables are scant, the cultivated zone having been seized by the soldiers.  There is plenty of water, owing to the number of wells and cisterns which were dug after the ten years’ war, when the Cubans cut off the supply.      Young Mendoza, who has been present at confidential interviews between his father and the generals, says the Spaniards have been expecting a general assault ever since the fight of June 24.      Linares has 10,000 men in the trenches.  Toral has 15,000 regulars, 5,000 volunteers (on which he places little reliance) and 1,200 men from Cervera’s fleet.      Toral is positive that the Americans cannot storm these defenses.      Mendoza says that Toral’s explanation of the failure to oppose the landing of Shafter’s army was:      “I haven’t enough men without leaving trenches unguarded on one side so the Americans could enter.”      Toral, it appears, blames Gen. Blanco bitterly for moving the bulk of the Santiago troops to Havana.  What is left is a mass of convalescents.      A Santiago newspaper, speaking of the fight of June 24, says: “Our force was but a small one, composed of small detachments from the block-houses in the Juragua Valley. It made a heroic stand, but was compelled to retire before superior numbers.”      According to the latest information Cervera’s ships are anchored in the same position ascertained and cabled ten days ago. POSTSCRIPT.—Outpost four miles beyond Hicucos—From this point Santiago is in plain sight, a mile ahead.  The Spanish outposts are swarming among the trees.  The rolling space is dotted with Cuban detachments acting as buffers between the two big bodies of armed men about to collide. Chaffee’s brigade holds the last American position before the entrenchments are finally attacked.
