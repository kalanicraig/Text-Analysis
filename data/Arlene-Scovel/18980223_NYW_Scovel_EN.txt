GEN. LEE ADVISES AMERICANS                    TO SEND THEIR FAMILIES                        AWAY FROM CUBA.                             -----      United States Naval Board of Inquiry Continues Its               Work in Secret, but Excitement in                 Havana Is Hourly Increasing.                             -----              EXPERTS BELIEVE MAINE WAS "MINED,"                 BUT NOT BY SPANISH OFFICIALS.                             -----   The World's Staff Correspondent Says that Adequate Proof            of a Crime Is Not Yet Furnished Nor Can               Internal Explosion Be Explained.                             -----             IMPORTANT FINDINGS BY DIVERS BEARING                 UPON THE CAUSE OF THE WRECK.                             -----     The Names of the Two Marines Who Slept Over the Main                   Forward Magazine and Yet                   Escaped with Their Lives.                             -----         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)         The World, Wednesday, February 23, 1898, p.1      HAVANA, Feb. 22, via Key West.--The situation to-night is more grave than at any time since the Maine explosion one week ago to-night.      Although the officers of the Naval Board of Inquiry preserve an impenetrable reserve, The World correspondent learns that some of the best naval experts now believe that the explosion was the result of treachery.      They do not believe that Spanish officials were part of the conspiracy.  From evidence now in their possession they believe the Spanish Government, Gen. Blanco and all his military subordinates were guiltless alike of knowledge of or participation in the crime.  The mine it is believed to have been set off by a fanatic.      Naval officers fear that when the facts are known it may be impossible to restrain public sentiment.  President McKinley and Secretary Long are said, frankly, by officials who have arrived directly from Washington, to be strenuously for peace.      Both hope that the Naval Board of Inquiry will be able to prove that no crime has been committed, even by a Spanish fanatic. 78      But the American officers fear trouble when all the facts are known.  They do not expect any public revelations, or any radical change in the situation.     DIVERS FIND CASE FOR TEN-INCH GUNS STILL FULL OF WET                            POWDER.                             -----          (By cable from World staff correspondent.)      HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 22.ÑIf the ten-inch and reserve magazines were not exploded completely the main deck and amidships annihilation came from some other immensely powerful force.  This point is intensely interesting and of the highest importance,      The divers employed in the forward part of the wreck are working in very dangerous quarters.      They have secured a powder case for the ten-inch guns. It was full of wet powder.                MUST BE READ BETWEEN THE LINES.      As the censor will not allow any mention of what the divers ascertain about the causes of the Maine disaster I shall have to merely mention the articles I saw aboard the Fern and allow The World's readers to put this and that together and draw their own conclusions.      Among those articles, in addition to the books, silverware, typewriter and Capt. Sigsbee's personal effects taken from the after part of the wreck, I saw both loaded and unloaded ten-inch shells.      A six-inch empty powder case was found yesterday.  It is know known that it came from the reserve magazine just next to the turret.  The powder holder was badly crushed (evidently as if the force came from without instead of from an explosion of its own contents.)      After target practice the big powder cases were put back into the rack from which they came and the smaller sizes were stored empty in the reserve-room.  The empty cases were carefully cared for.                  FLOODING OF THE MAGAZINES.      Capt. Sigsbee's discipline has been superb.  At the first moment of the terrible shock he was calm.      He quickly ordered the magazines to be flooded and by this quick coolness he prevented the explosion of the forward explosives.      If they had gone also then no one could have survived, from Capt. Sigsbee to brave Marine Orderly Anthony.      The Maine's discipline has been superb under the strongest trial.      No diving has been done outside the wreck, being forbidden by order of the Spanish authorities. 79                  POSITION OF THE MAGAZINES.      The position of the magazines is as follows:      Under the forward turret is the big magazine, with 190 powder cases of 200 pounds each.      Next to it, toward the left side, is the shell room for the big guns.      Next to that is the reserve magazine, containing only a few small shells and 200 pounds of saluting powder.      Forward of this strip of magazines, which probably are intact, comes the small-arms cartridge magazine.      Then, still further forward, comes the service six- inch magazine.      Very good steel was used in the Maine, as is shown by the manner in which the main deck folded over without breaking a beam, though, of course, it was not subjected to strain from the big powder holder.               DISPOSITION OF BODIES NOW FOUND.      The bodies or rather the unsightly lumps that once were hardy, healthy sailor lads--are taken aboard big lighters, examined by the devoted chaplain, Chidwick, and hastily put into cheap coffins, half full of lime and creolin to speedily finish decomposition and deodorize the operation.      One hundred and fifty-seven bodies thus far have been recovered and six men have died in hospital.  Twelve bodies were recovered to-day.  Eight were very fragmentary.      Chaplain Chidwick is faithful in his awful task.      The big wrecking tug has not arrived.      A member of the Court of Inquiry says the tug Neptune cannot raise the heavy guns, as her cranes are of only fifteen tons capacity, while the guns weigh twenty-five tons apiece.      Capt. Sigsbee's pennant also found to-day.      Cablegrams from friends and families have about ceased.  At first they came in a flood.      The divers report that the forward part is jammed with bodies.          DEATH CAUGHT THEM TRYING TO QUIT HAMMOCKS.      Many of these have arms upraised and fingers clutched as if reaching upward for the handles in the deck overhead in trying to get quickly out of the hammocks.  The second great explosion came too quickly for that.  They are somewhat broken by falling angle irons and beams, and are very badly decomposed.      Reddin is a man of wonderful nerve.  He was badly shaken up by the explosion, and had a miraculous escape through the top of the Maine's rear turret, yet he is doing 80 good work, notwithstanding that he is without electric light, that having failed so far.  Therefore, he can only go down to the submerged main deck.      He was almost killed by the Captain's sideboard falling upon him while he was groping in the Captain's cabin.             KOEHLER IS DEAD; HOLZER MAY SURVIVE.      Goerge Koehler, of Brooklyn, died in San Ambrosio Hospital last night at midnight.  He had been delirious two days.      Holzer has a chance of living.  He was slightly better to-day.  Even after the last sacrament was administered to him he said, "I'm going to try not to die yet."  Sister Wilberforce, who was with Koehler while he was dying, is doing a great and noble work. 81 COURT OF INQUIRY OPENS IN HAVANA.-----Lieut. Holman, the Maine's Navigator and Ordnance Officer, and Lieut. Commander Wainwright,Executive Officer, Give Testimony.-----BLANCO AND SPANISH ADMIRALOFFER ALL THE AID THEY CAN GIVE.-----Gunner Morgan, of the New York, Giving Special Attention to Ammunition in Fore Part of Hull,But Sworn to Secrecy.-----The World, Wednesday, February 23, 1898, p. 2      HAVANA, Feb. 22--The Court of Inquiry opened at 10:30 A.M. and took a recess at 12:30 P.M.      G. F. W. Holman, navigator and ordnance officer of the Maine, was examined at the morning session.      The court met for the afternoon session at 1:30 P.M. Lieutenant-Commander R. Wainwright, executive officer of the Maine, was called to the witness stand. Lieutenant- Commander Wainwright has been in immediate charge of the wreck since the explosion.                    COURT HELD ON MANGROVE.      There was nothing picturesque or impressive in the scenes in or about the lighthouse tender Mangrove, in which the Court of Inquiry sat to-day. The Mangrove, which is small and rather ancient- looking, lies near the wreck on the side furthest from Havana, with the Fern and the Bache respectively north and south of her. All are moored to buoys and swing with the tide.      Boats from various vessels or from the wharves ply to and fro in the harbor with passengers eager to inspect the rigid-looking mass of steel and iron which is all that is left of a great battleship.      On the Mangrove the sessions of the court were held in the Captain's cabin aft.  The officers were not in full dress, but in the uniform used every day aboard ship.      The proceedings were very quiet, no one but the witnesses and the shorthand reporter being admitted.      The arrangement is that the stenographer shall write out his notes day by day, and the court will adjourn from time to time to give him the opportunity, as was the case to-day when the court again visited the wreck and spent some time in additional inspection. 82      The pomp and circumstance of the tribunal are not as much as an ordinary garrison court-martial would show, but the high character of its members and the evident earnestness of their purpose to find the truth if possible give dignity to the Court of Inquiry.                 OFFICIAL VISITS OF COURTESY.      The officers of the court paid another visit to the wreck to-day.      After the visits of the members of the court to the Captain-General and Admiral Manterola this morning, Capt. Sampson said the reception extended to them was polite and cordial.      The Captain-General and Admiral expressed deep sympathy and the hope that nothing would interfere to prevent a thorough investigation.  They offered to give any help in their power.  Capt. Sampson referred to the visits as "tending to promote a better understanding." Judge Peral, of the Spanish Admiralty Court, has been taking to-day the depositions of the officers of the Spanish vessels and the harbor officials on the subject of the disaster to the Maine.                   DIVERS GROPE IN DARKNESS.      Four divers are at work, two in the fore part of the ship, the others aft.      The task is most laborious.  The men, naturally, are extremely careful, as they have had to work in complete darkness.  Several have had bad falls.      Gunner Charles Morgan, of the cruiser New York, who is in charge of the divers will devote special attention to examining the ammunition in the fore part of the Maine's hull, and to ascertain the condition of the plates, magazines and engines.      He is a graduate in gunnery, and is regarded as entirely competent, as indeed are all the divers under his direction.  He is under strict orders not to give out anything on the subject of his investigations except to the officers of the Court of Inquiry when called upon.      Two cases of ten-inch ammunition have been found forward.  One had exploded; the other was full of powder.      Electric lights, worked from the Mangrove, are now available, and much good is expected from them.      Nearly all the possible salvage has now been made from the cabin aft.      The efforts to reach the ward and mess rooms are frustrated by some unknown obstacle.  It is expected to find bodies in those rooms.      Among the salvage were the table ware and the silver                              83 service belonging to the Maine.The work of securing the bodies under the hatch has been most difficult in the dark, but it is hoped that the electric lights will be of great assistance.  The bodies are much mutilated, and some are partially burned.                   CAPT. SIGSBEE IS BETTER.      Capt. Sigsbee has been under a great strain, but is now much better having been relieved of some of the responsibility by the presence here of the United States Court of Inquiry.      La Lucha comments upon the "unfairness of the United States in making Capt. Sigsbee the adviser and assistant of the Court of Inquiry."  The editorial evidently is based on incorrect information from the United States as naval officers here say it is impossible, under the rules constituting naval courts of inquiry, that the captain commanding the ship destroyed should have anything to do with the findings of the court, being in one sense on trial himself.  It is made Capt. Sigsbee's duty to give all the testimony as to the facts in his possession.      La Lucha claims also that the Court of Inquiry is not constituted as it would be by any other of the great powers, but in this particular the paper evidently is laboring under further misinformation.                  GUANABACOA FESTIVITIES STOPPED.      The military commander of Guanabacoa has ordered the suspension of public festivities as a mark of respect to the memory of the Maine's dead.  The prohibition will continue for three days.      An additional 10-inch casing charge was found to-day exploded.      A number of such casings are believed to be inside the hull, but it is not known whether they exploded or not.       SPANISH COMMANDERS GRACIOUS TO MEMBERS OF OUR COURT OF                           INQUIRY.            (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)      HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 22.ÑThe members of the United States Naval Court of Inquiry promptly finished to-day their official visits of courtesy upon the local Spanish authorities.      They were courteously received by Captain-General Blanco and the Admiral in command of the Spanish naval forces in Cuba.      The court of inquiry probably will not be through with its preliminary work here for three or four days.  The members say they may have to return later.      They took testimony all day after making the official                              84 visits, and spent two hours on a lighter watching the submarine work.      I presented to-day to Capt. Sampson, the President of the court, copies of all The World's photographs of the Maine wreck and position.  He was much pleased. President Sampson looks quite worn and ill.The members of the court are crowded on the Mangrove. The A. P. Bache probably will not leave until Thursday.  She is waiting until the wounded men recover sufficiently to be moved.      All the members of the court dined with Gen. Lee to- night.  The dinner was extremely quiet, with no great display of flowers or music.
