CERVERA’S DEFEAT MADE SPAIN’S                   ARMY THINK OF SURRENDER. (Special Cable Despatch to The World.) The World, Wednesday, July 6, 1898, p. 2      SIBONEY, July 3, via Port Antonio, July 5.—I have just returned from a trip to the front, having made my way nearly along the entire distance of the long thin line, as the commanding general calls it, with which Santiago is invested, and which reaches from El Caney to the coast.      It is now known definitely that Gen. Pando and his 6,000 men have formed a junction with the Spanish forces at Santiago.  Gen. Garcia was unable to furnish sufficient opposition with the few hundred men he had at his command. This reinforcing put great heart into the Spaniards inside of the beleaguered city, and this morning they were very proud and haughty.  They knew that we had met with tremendous losses, and they felt confident that our troops had not yet mastered the true inwardness of Spanish bushwacking, guerilla warfare.      Therefore when Gen. Shafter in the morning sent in a demand for a surrender there was not very much hesitation in sending out a reply that they would die in the last ditch if necessary, but that they would never haul down their flag.      But this haughty feeling soon vanished.  Cervera made his great dash for liberty and the Spaniards on land felt for a time that he would succeed.  Lookouts had been placed, who flashed the news of the progress of the naval engagement from time to time straight to the military headquarters in the city of Santiago.  The besieged Spaniards knew of the fate of Cervera’s fleet even before the intelligence had reached the American forces on land.      Immediately a hasty conference of Spanish generals convened, and at this time they are in conference, and it is believed that they will at once reopen negotiations for the surrender of the city and will communicate their decision to Gen. Wheeler.  Their surrender is deemed possible to-morrow.      I have this information from Col. Astor, of Gen. Shafter’s staff.  He has just passed a courier, who gave him the news.
