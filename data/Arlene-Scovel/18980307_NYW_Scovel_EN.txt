CONSUL BARKER RESIGNS HIS POST AT SAGUA IN DISGUST.                             -----        Can No Longer Stand Our Government’s Inactivity        And Indifference to the Horrors of the Spanish               Policy of Extermination in Cuba.                             -----                 RESIGNATION OF OTHER CONSULS              EXPECTED DAILY FOR THE SAME REASON.                             -----      The World Correspondent Wires that If the Consular         Reports Were Made Public an Angry Shout Would                  Go Up from Maine to Texas.                             -----       (Special from a World Staff Correspondent.  Sent   from Havana to Key West by The World’s Despatch Steamer.)       On Board The World’s Express Steamer Confidence,            The World, Monday, March 7, 1898, p. 2                                     Havana, Harbor, March 6.      Consul Walter B. Barker, stationed at Sagua La Grande, has resigned.  He feels that the American Government, in its inactivity regarding Cuban affairs, has ignored all the Consular reports, and that the Consuls, to all intents and purposes, are useless as channels of information.      The present Spanish Minister of the colonies when a Senator quoted the American Consular reports in the Spanish Cortes to show that war in Cuba was inevitable unless great reforms were granted.  Consul Barker’s reports especially were referred to, and all the reports were characterized as “calm statements of cool-blooded men used to telling the truth to their Government.”      Senor Moret was right.  War did come.      But the American Government paid less attention to its own agent’s reports than even Spain did, or the war would have ended long ago.  Some hundreds of millions and hundreds of thousands of lives would have been saved and the Maine would not have been blown up unawares if the American Government had acted on the reports of the American Consuls in Cuba.           IF THE REPORTS WERE GIVEN TO THE PUBLIC.      If the detailed, exact information of eye-witnesses officially received from Cuba were unreservedly given to the American people an angry shout would rise from Maine to Texas.      In face of horrors beyond description, in face of the 140 loss to American interests despite the now known fact that the Cuban war is hopeless for both sides, and in the full consciousness that its intervention will be forced finally, anyhow, the Government of the United States simply has allowed Spain to drag, drag along and starve to death much more than a third of her still loyal Cuban subjects, while meanwhile she has been utterly unable to crush the revolutionists.      Consul Walter B. Barker fought throughout the civil war:  He has a considerable fortune, which is safely invested.  He is neither timid nor rash.      Leading Wall street men and Senators signed for his retention in office, and he earnestly wished “to see the war through.”  But Mr. Barker has two things—a heart and a conscience.  And no man with those two things and courage could be brought into daily contact with the cold-blooded horror of Cuba’s war (or rather Cuba’s premeditated starvation) in one of Cuba’s smaller towns without doing just what Mr. Barker has done—just refuse to lend official countenance, even though but a very humble official, to further American toleration of Spain’s cruelty in Cuba.                    CAN STAND IT NO LONGER.      Walter B. Barker simple has reached the position in regard to the general attitude of the United States Government toward the hopeless destruction in Cuba called “war” that Gen. Lee did regarding the treatment of American citizens when he cabled to Secretary Olney:  “I cannot stand another R[. . .] murder.”      The Spanish press in Havana generally tries to discredit the American Red Cross efforts and to stop the arrival of American food in order to thus complete Cuban extermination.  The Spaniards themselves admit that to be Spain’s only hope for a stable Spanish Cuba.      They allege that Consul Barker’s resignation is on account of friction with Gen. Lee over the improper distribution of American charity.  Although Sagua, on account of its distance from Havana, is one of the last places reached, I am able to state that Mr. Barker is a warm friend of Gen. Lee, and, further, of the present Administration at Washington.  He writes personally:      “I have received from the present Administration marked attention, for which I shall ever feel grateful.”      Mr. Barker has no personal motives.  His resignation is a noble protest against a shameful governmental policy.                 OTHER RESIGNATIONS EXPECTED.      Other resignations are expected daily.      In these times the position of a United States Consul                              141 is most trying even if prompt support always came from Washington.      Senator Quay’s nominee for the Matanzas Consulate, Mr. Saylor, came, looked the ground over, spoke of renting the handsomest house in town, told Consul Brice all about the Cuban war, and then took a steamer back to Quay’s private car, which he said awaited him in Tampa, not at all sure he wanted the place.      And solid Mr. Brice hangs on against his personal wishes because there are hundreds of hungry American citizens to feed and protect from insult and injury.      Capt. Hyatt, of Santiago, is another able representative who feels keenly his Government’s apathy.           MAINE DISASTER HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.      A general resignation may be expected of American officials ashamed of the Government which once was honored in Cuba.  The Maine horror, whether caused by an ultra- Spaniards’ boiler torpedo or the Spanish Government’s submarine mine, has had nothing to do with their resolution.      It took the loss of two hundred and sixty murdered American sailors to fix American attention upon Cuba.  May the brave action of Walter B. Barker and the attitude of his fellow-Consuls drive public insight further into the Cuban question until every man, woman and child understand that the Cuban war is the starvation of a peaceful population, the impotence of the armed sections and the destruction of everything material.  And that they may fully appreciate that further war in Cuba is useless to Spain, ruinous to Cuba and finally means war for the United States in any event, let them demand the publication in full of all the Consular reports.      Spaniard Moret said:  “Remember that these men are accustomed to tell the truth to their governments.” 142     SPAIN ANGRY BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS TOLD ABOUT THE MAINE                            -----      Havana’s Police Chief Calls Yankee Correspondents         Liars and Pigs, Says They Must Leave Havana                And Thrusts One Into Cabanas.                            -----                 NO ACCUSATION HAS BEEN MADE;                 ONLY APPARENT FACTS PRINTED.                            -----     But Blanco Seems to Be Dominated Now by the Fury of          the Loyalists, Who Have Grown Jubilant on           Seeing Two of Their Best Fighting Ships                    Beside the Maine Wreck                             -----  (Special from a World Staff Correspondent, Sent from Havana                   to Key West by Steamer.)       On Board The World’s Despatch Steamer Confidence.            The World, Monday, March 7, 1898, p. 3                                       Havana Harbor, March 6      The daily tirade against the American correspondents here has taken a more active form.      Honore Laine has been arrested and placed incommunicado, “charged” with being a representative of New York newspaper and with having said that the Maine was blown up by a mine or a torpedo.      Chief of Police Paglieri was frank to rudeness in his remarks on the subject.  He seemed to feel that the mere statement of a universally apparent fact incriminates the Spanish Government, though no Havana correspondent  has even hinted at such a thing.      Laine’s imprisonment indicates that Gen. Blanco is yielding to the popular clamor which Col. Pagliari voices.      There is no charge of complicity with the rebels nor of forwarding insurgent correspondence—nothing but stating facts objected to.  The harder the fact the keener seems to be the sting.      No correspondent claims that the patent fact that the Maine was blown up is a calumny against Spain.  But Col. Paglieri informed me that Laine was to be expelled and that I and others were to follow him shortly.      Laine, a cultured musician, linguist and inventor, wore away fourteen anxious months in a Cabanas dungeon, and the very thought of reincarceration there appalled him.  He 143 told me once that he would rather shoot himself than endure the torture again.      I saw him at 2 o’clock yesterday morning.  Although he was incommunicado, he hadn’t yet been put behind the bars.      “Are you arrested, too?” he asked quickly.      “Why here?” I popped out.      “Don’t know,” he answered.  “See Gen. Lee first thing in morning.”                  GEN. LEE FELT COMPLIMENTED.      That was all.  I saw Gen. Lee at once.  He knew nothing of the affair, but seemed pleased that Laine, a French citizen, had claimed his energetic protection rather than that of his own Consul.      I hunted up Chief of Police Paglieri, who gave me to understand that Laine was to be sent to the United States. If I understood correctly, then Laine’s incarceration in the awful Cabanas was exquisitely cruel.      Co. Paglieri’s comrades were ashamed of his coarse attacks on the correspondents, and several of them left. He continued outlining a new Government policy.      If what the incensed Chief of Police said of Gen. Blanco is true, then even James Gordon Bennett’s men will have to go.               NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED BY BLUSTER.      I told Col. Paglieri, just as I had previously told Gen. Solano, Gen. Pando, Secretary-General Congosto and others, that when they produced in print over my signature any statement of any fact non-existent or twisted I should take the hint and the next northbound steamer.      Co. Paglieri’s words were strong as well as coarse.      “Spain has got tired of you American correspondents— you canaille, you pigs!”      Right here I had to stop him.      Then he explained how cordial the American-Spanish relations are and how the countries would love each other if it were not for the newspapers.      If Gen. Blanco was quoted correctly—and other recent statements of high palace officials indicate that he was— the garrote is to be applied to the truth in Cuba with more torsion than ever Weyler knew how to apply, and the correspondents are to be under an espionage as rigorous as is the censorship of their cable dispatches.  In fact, it is hardly safe now for a Cuban to talk with an American correspondent.            PRESSURE OF IGNORANCE AND INTOLERANCE.      Thus it is that the “great reforms,” “liberal policy” and “Cuban home rule” are “progressing.”  It is not Gen.                              144 Blanco’s fault.  But he cannot stand the pressure of those people who honestly believe that the Maine’s officers were all ashore Feb. 15, that her discipline was lax, that she was badly built, that she exploded in consequence of the carelessness of her officers and men, and that any other explanation or even theory is an insult to “gentlemanly Spain” from the Americans—a race, as their illustrated papers tell them and their journals state, which is “composed principally of fat pigs only fit to be struck with Spanish bayonets.”      This is no fable.  A glance into any local paper shows it clearly.      Now that the rockets have ceased to whiz, the bands to play, the cheers to roar and the cannon to salute the Almirante Oquendo and welcome her to an anchorage near her big twin, Vizcaya, the same ignorant people look at them, then at the Maine’s scrap-iron pile and the United States “man-of-war” Fern and laugh.      Their papers print meanwhile new clamors for the suppression of truth from Cuba—that thing which is the hardest to get—and to demand the wholesale expulsion of American correspondents.       POWELSON TESTIFIED TO PRECISELY THE WORLD’S NEWS. I am able to state that Ensign Powelson did not testify before the Court of Inquiry that the Maine’s keel was blown upward.  That would have been a remarkable statement and would have proved clearly an outside explosion, by the testimony of a Government witness, of large size.  What the clever officer did find was—exactly as was stated in The World—that one of the Maine’s port bottom plates, with a stiffening plate attached, was blown up, apparently from the port side, and that the ship’s side had simply straightened until it protruded several feet above the water.      American naval officers are indignant at the use of Powelson’s name.  They say that although one correspondent of the paper in question says he doesn’t know the officer in question, yet there are half a dozen others who do, and the general public idea would be that Powelson had disobeyed orders and talked.  This I am sure he did not do.      Another New York newspaper tale of an electric wire, merchants of Muralla street and native divers who mysteriously disappeared has proved on investigation to be a mistake.      The day after the disaster a man came to The World correspondent, saying that he had an Italian friend who was willing to swear before Gen. Lee to an incriminating 145 conversation heard on the Regia ferry-boat between Spanish naval officers on the morning of the explosion.  He was sent to Consul-General Lee.  His friend testified and talked later.      The rumor of a rope—since confirmed by The World—was mistaken by the other daily as a wire, and the story of “just how the Maine was blown up” was sprung upon a long- suffering public.               ALL HAVANA DIVERS ACCOUNTED FOR.      Careful search reveals the fact that all the Cuban and Spanish divers are accounted for.  The alleged mysterious deaths were from natural causes, and one occurred six weeks before the Maine disaster.  The other, on Feb. 21, was that of a man who had been partly bedridden for two years.      Mrs. Bustillo, the mother of the young ladies reported to have been warned against visiting the Maine Feb. 6 because the ship might be blown up, tells The World that her daughters never accompanied Mr. Dionesco Suarez, nor saw any Spanish naval officer at Machina.      Perhaps the highest American naval expert here, and one who knows all that the investigation has proved, says The World has secured all the important proofs which have been found.  The articles brought up now only tell corroborative tales, though they would be most important as evidence before an international board of investigation, which The World’s exclu-[. . .] shippers.  They add that the distress here is not so extreme nor the charity sent of such extent as to relieve our own citizens.      They assert that the legal sale of condensed milk by importers is impossible, as a box of it costs $14 in gold with the duties, while it is sold in many stores at $10 in silver, and in single cans is offered for sale by persons unknown to the commercial houses.      They assert that the medicines are received in quantities for annual consumption, quinine being offered for sale by weight, whereas doses are given in grains.      It is asserted also that in the warehouses of San Jose, where the Red Cross supplies are received and stored, the authorities have discovered a package imported on the steamship Seguranca containing watches, jewelry and other dutiable articles.  The package is said to be held by the customs officials.      The papers call for vigorous action on the part of the director of the Custom-House to enforce the laws for the punishment of the offenders.      Nobody is openly accused, but the papers sound a note of alarm. 146 It is a continuation of the howl made daily on seeing the reconcentrados sell milk for cigarettes.  It is universal now, owing to the increase of Spanish arrogance following the arrival of Spanish warships.
