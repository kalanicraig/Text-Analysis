CERVERA’S SHIPS MAY BE EASILY                 DESTROYED AND SANTIAGO TAKEN.     (Special Cable Despatch from a Staff Correspondent.)            The World, Tuesday, June 21, 1898, p. 2      CAMP OF COL. CEBRECO, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SANTIAGO, June 18, via Port Antonio, June 20.—I to-day plainly saw from Mount San Augustin Admiral Cervera’s squadron placidly at anchor in Santiago Harbor.  All of the warships were unharmed, sensational reports to the contrary notwithstanding. I saw in the harbor five Spanish warships, two torpedo-destroyers and one gunboat, only two leagues distant. A powerful telescope brought the well-known masts, turrets and funnels of the Vizcaya, Oquendo and Maria Teresa into bold relief against the glassy water.      The three sister ships were anchored one and a half, two and two and a half miles north of Morro Castle.  The southward one was riding half a mile north of Smith Key, with a torpedo-boat destroyer nestled alongside.      The middle one was just east of Central Key, where the harbor narrows.      This key is occupied by an ancient low powder magazine, which was mistaken by the only previous American observer for a destroyer.      Within 100 yards northeast of the key is a gunboat, with one funnel and two pole-masts.  According to the Adjutant-General’s circular, she may be any one of six similar gunboats in Cuban waters.      Northward, one-quarter of a mile due north of Central Key, the Cristobal Colon rides, three miles from Morro Castle.      Unless they are moved daily it is possible that all might be annihilated by a concentrated, plunging fire over the coast bluffs from Sampson’s big guns or by their guns stationed at the point used to-day by The World correspondent.  It would be impossible for the Spaniards to take the point in less than a week.  There are too many determined Cubans for that.      In the mean time it might be used as a signal station from which to direct the fire of Sampson’s ships accurately at each shot.      To-day three of Cervera’s ships were without steam and greatly endangered.  Especially exposed was the Reina Mercedes, with useless boilers, which was anchored just 315 behind Smith Key, with a destroyer near astern.  The Cubans say all her guns are still aboard her, making her a most valuable floating battery.      There are two accurate charts of Santiago Harbor.  Two copies could be plotted into squares, one to be taken to the mountain, with a screened wig-wag or [. . .] and the other to be kept on the New York.  With these it would probably be possible to telegraph accurately enough to determine constantly Cervera’s positions and sink his ships.      If they should be withdrawn from the entrance to the northern part of the bay the entrance could be dragged to clear it of torpedoes, and Sampson’s giants could enter and battle with the Spaniards on their own ground.      In any event the operation of the plan, which is entirely practicable, would keep Cervera’s ships in constant movement or compel their sure loss.  The constant movement would exhaust soon his slender stock of coal. Then his destruction would be an easy matter.  It probably would mean his surrender and with Cervera’s ships goes Santiago.      Gen. Linares is energetically entrenching, outposting and trying to occupy heights, as I exclusively cabled; commanding the best landing places for the Americans.  He has not enough troops to accomplish all this.      If the transports stop fifty miles west and out of sight of Santiago and land all the Americans, mountain guns, cavalry and sharpshooters in the night time at a base on the coast near the hills, which The World correspondent mapped to-day, they can easily capture all the outlying forces, and from a commanding mountain side shell the city’s defenders from their trenches.      These trenches are extensive.  They extend behind the coast bluffs and are protected thereby from Sampson’s fire, which must have a big elevation at the short range necessary to cover the troops landing.  But by outwitting the Spaniards it is possible to annihilate them as indicated.      The Spanish hill posts necessary to be taken are: Coletta, the cleared crest of a hill six miles inland, northwest of Cubana, to-day in process of fortification by infantry with a small force of cavalry; Bartolon, on the same line, eight miles inland, garrisoned with fifty infantrymen; Monte Real, on the same line, ten miles inland, a stone block house garrisoned by 100 men.
