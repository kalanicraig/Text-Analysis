EXPERTS AT HAVANA SAY                   SOME GREAT EXTERIOR FORCE                    RENT AND SUNK THE SHIP.                             -----   If the 10-Inch Magazine Had Let Go Its Store of Explosive        Force, the Vessel Would Have Been Pulverized--              Believed that the Forward Magazines                    Are Practically Intact.                             -----     (Special Despatch from a World Staff Correspondent.)    [The following highly important despatch is sent by The World's staff correspondent in Havana by The World's despatch boat to Key West, and telegraphed hence to The World.  He was not able to send this information before because of the strict censorship of matter sent by cable.] The World, Thursday, February 24, 1898, p. 1      HAVANA, Cuba 10 A.M., by way of Key West, Fla., Feb. 23--There is not one chance in a hundred but that the Maine was blown up deliberately.      Whether a mine detonating key was mistaken for a testing key or whether a mammoth contact torpedo broke its moorings by accident, the awful, astounding thing is that up to now there have been discovered fifty actual, positive physical proofs of the tragic fact.      Against it are only a few theories and suppositions.      Persons whose information and judgment command respect believe privately, though they may not say it openly, that the Maine was blown up through some outside agency.      They point to the fact that the only boilers which had steam up were in the part of the wreck which is intact now.      Spontaneous combustion, they say, was impossible in the bunkers, for the oldest coal in the exploded region had been aboard only three months.      The theory of spontaneous combustion in the magazines is disproved, these same experts say, for it would have influenced and exploded all the powder cases alike.      I shall not rush conclusions.  I shall simply present the proof so far discovered on both sides, quoting naval expert testimony and allowing physical discoveries their just value.      I shall also give the arguments on the Spanish side and I shall state both as though I were under oath to the President of the United States in a case involving a national cataclysm or an international war. 86      It is now a hundred and eighty hours since the Maine's death throes shook Havana.  Of these one hundred and thirty have been spent in examining the wreck and wreckage, the things found and the men who found them, and in subjecting each to experts.      Here are the results:      It seems absolutely certain--and it is exactly so unless the laws of nature changed Feb. 15--that the almost utter annihilation of the Maine cannot possibly have been caused by the explosion in any manner of even fifty times the amount of powder now conservatively known to have exploded in the Maine's interior.      It is well known that the rear group of big and little magazines is intact.      Those magazines did not explode.  That portion of the Maine is practically uninjured.      Indeed the hull is not badly hurt for the length of forty feet forward of the after magazines.  The heavy across-ship steel bulkhead between the two sets of boilers at this point is practically entire.      The only explosions in the Maine which could have broken her are much forward of this bulkhead.      The big ten-inch magazine--with a hundred and ninety service charges of two hundred and fifty pounds each--was forty-five feet from it.      Had its contents--or half of them--exploded, naval experts say the whole ship would have been pulverized.  Yet forty-five feet from it the Maine is practically intact.      But the damage done is too great for the explosion of the small magazine adjoining the ten-inch magazine, and its shell room called the "reserve magazine."      Empty six-inch and ten-inch powder cases were stored there after the target practice, and it contained not over two thousand pounds of saluting powder.      It could not have caused one-tenth of the damage done even in the forty-foot space between the forward turret and the centre of the boilers mentioned.      A good deal is definitely known about the two other forward magazines.  They were small.      One was immediately forward of the big magazine.  It was called the "fixed ammunition magazine," and contained six-pound and one-pound loaded shells.      Inasmuch as the ten-inch shells in the big magazine, the shell room and the rear apartment--the vortex of the explosion--did not explode, the little ones surely are intact.      Or if they did explode they did comparatively little 87 damage.      The only other forward magazine was the service six- inch powder and shell room immediately forward of the fixed ammunition magazine.      Nothing is known about it except that, being so far forward, in the opinion of experts is explosion would not have effected the total annihilation of the central portion of the Maine. 88 FIFTY PHYSICAL PROOFS THAT MAINE WAS BLOWN UPBY A MINE OR A TORPEDO.-----World Correspondent Brings Out the Awful Truth--Fifty Times the Amount of Powder Which Is Knownto Have Exploded Within the Maine CouldNot Have Wrought the Dreadful Havoc.-----The World, Thursday, February 24, 1898, p. 1      However, these three little magazines play a small part in the Maine horror.  They are described simply as a part of the forward explosives which might have aided in the wrecking of the ship.      All depends on the big magazine.      There have been raised from the forward part two apparently conflicting things:      One is a ten-inch powder case still loaded.      The other is an empty one, smashed and burned.      But as I am competently informed now that the empty ten inch cases were piled after target practice in the reserve magazine instead of going back into their holes in the ten-inch magazine, this raised torn case seems to have been a spare or a used case, to which the explosion of the saluting powder in the reserve magazine, or any other explosives, may have given an exploded appearance.      Expert authority states that if the ruptured case had exploded, its own iron handles would have blown off.  They are on now.      Further inspection of day before yesterday's find of a six-inch case shows that its appearance might have been caused by fire and an outside explosive pressure.      A leading member of the Court of Inquiry thinks that neither the six- nor the ten-inch empty case found was necessarily detonated.  Both almost surely came from the reserve magazine, where both were stored.      But these are only weak negative proofs.      The recovering of a big ten-inch case with its cap sprung and the unexploded powder openly exposed is direct, absolute, positive proof that no great proportion of the twenty-five tons of the big magazine's powder exploded, and every expert, every man of common sense rejects the idea that even one charge of one-half pound or one hundred and twenty-five pounds of powder could explode in the closed magazine, holding 380 similar thin copper cylinders, each filled with red powder and each having its eight one-inch hexagons of quick-burning, black, detonating powder, 89 without the explosion of all.      Had ten exploded, the explosion of all would have been absolutely assured under any and all possible conditions.      But there is one gaping case of powder which is filled and unexploded.      Even if ten big cases did go, and, to them were added all the saluting powder and the rest of the forward explosives, the combined explosion could not have burst open the Maine from left to right, a full average of seventy feet away or have done the actual, awful damage the divers find.      I have stated the worst possible case of an interior explosion.      The general idea of all experts is that none of th[e] forward magazines, except the unimportant reserve one, has exploded, but that some great exterior force annihilated the ship.      Again let me say:  Without the general explosion of the big forward magazine the damage to the Maine was impossible except from a big mine or a mammoth--a very mammoth--torpedo.      The big magazine did not explode, because everything on the wreck above and below the water has been hurled toward it.  A movable object doesn't approach an explosion of twenty-five tons of powder.      In addition to the previous description of the main deck being curled over from the port side, while the magazine is on the starboard, and other things seen above water, I can now give more convincing proofs of the innocence of the magazine in the affair.      The divers find that ten-inch shells, which were in the exact centre of the ship, opposite the big magazine, are now partly on the starboard side, about the location of the magazine.  They are unexploded and can be again used.      They were actually thrown against the shattered magazine.  If that had gone pieces of ten-inch shells would have covered Havana's water front.      Another significant fact is that a grate bar from the boilers was found to-day in the forward part of the ship, near the magazine in question.  It would have gone the other way had the magazine exploded.      This grate bar is strong proof of The World's original claim that in all probability the ship was destroyed beginning on the port side at the centre of the Maine.      Further proof that no big magazine exploded is found in the fact that bodies are found close in and not burned, but only pierced by beams and debris. 90 Another proof is that three men who were sleeping twenty feet from the magazine in a cutter--their names were cabled to the World--were saved. So also were loaded cases and shells from the loading room above the magazine.      No ten-inch fragment was found on the steamer City of Washington or ashore.      Moreover the main deck is curled toward the magazine instead of away from it.      Now that it is known that but few if any loaded cases were in the reserve magazine, the significance is taken from the discovery of the collapsed six-inch case found two days ago.      On the other hand, the place where the Maine lay was one where the ship seldom swung when moored to the Government buoy.  It would seem to be the worst place to put a Government mine.      Besides, the time of night was ill chosen, if total loss was desired.      Furthermore, if war was desired, this was the worst way to bring it, for now revenge enters in.      Then the action was so fiendish as to be too much for even the Spanish Government.  Probably it was done by a fanatic or a drunken attache or a man by the Cuban laborante, who want war. 91                       WORLD PHOTOGRAPHS                      PRAISED IN HAVANA.                             -----       Scovel Threatened with Arrest for Trying to Scare           Away from the Maine Hideous Carrion Crows           Perched on the Wreck, Waiting to Feast on              Our Sailor Dead—Americans Leaving.                             -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.) The World, Thursday, February 24, 1898, p. 2 Havana, Cuba, Feb. 23, 8.30 P.M.—Very favorable comments are made here upon The World’s big side view photograph of the Maine, showing not only the intact part of the hull but also the three plates which stick up in a melancholy manner as the sole remains above water of the forward part of the vessel, the rear one of which is thickly coated with green, anti-fouling paint.      Upon these were perched “auras,” or carrion crows.      There were four of them to-day on the third one of these solitary plates.  They faced me, their ugly hooded heads looking over the dinged, mashed, painted side, and their draggling tails hanging over the thick sides.      They appeared as if perched upon one of the Maine’s bottom plates, eating the dead.                    EXTRA-VIGILANT PATROL.      I got closer to drive them off, but the vigilant Spanish patrol boat almost arrested me for going too close to the wreck.  My boatmen were all afraid we would be fined heavily.      The fact that Spain has jurisdiction over the water almost stops the investigations of the American correspondents.  All that is permitted them is to write about the bodies recovered or anathematize the censor.      The Maine looks desolate except where the green bottom paint or white spar paint was not seared by the explosion.                   AMERICANS LEAVING HAVANA.      The following Americans have left Havana by the steamer Olivette:      Isaac Bernheim.      William Powers.      G. F. W. Holman.      Francisco Del Valle.      Montgomery H. Dingee.      Joseph Floyd Gordon. 92      Herbert Leigh Moorman.      Edward M. Abbey.      Julia A. Dudley.      George S. Hyatt.      Three more bodies have been recovered, making 160 in all.      The divers entered Merritt’s room, but did not find his body.      They brought out several six and ten inch powder cases, some of them exploded.      Holzer is very ill.  The rest of the wounded are doing well. 93          MAINE MUTELY TESTIFYING TO CAUSE OF HORROR.                             -----       Articles Brought Up by Divers and the Places They               Come From Are Telling the Tale to                  Experts Who Understand it.                             -----                 WORLD BOAT CONSTANTLY BESIDE                  THE HULK, KEENLY WATCHING.                             -----   Wreckers Work Energetically on Forward Turret, the State           and Position of Which May Decide Between                    Accident or Treachery.                             -----         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)         The World, Thursday, February 24, 1898, p. 2                                       HAVANA, CUBA, Feb. 23.      I have hired a small sailboat, put a table in it and spent all the time in the vicinity of the wreck.      The things that come up and the places they come from are telling the tale.      The American Naval Court of Inquiry is very active.      Pres. Sampson was aboard the wrecking tug very early this morning, directing preparations for energetic work on the forward turret.                 THE TURRET MAY SOLVE MYSTERY.      That, probably, will be sought for first.  It will tell a good deal, especially if its top is still on.      It was directly over the big powder room, with the electric light machinery and the hydraulic pumps between.      No more loaded or empty powder cases were brought up to-day.      I am informed there are plenty of loaded ones still down forward.      That, probably, will be sought for first.  It will tell a good deal, especially if its top is still on.      It was directly over the big powder room, with the electric light machinery and the hydraulic pumps between.      No more loaded or empty powder cases were brought up to-day.      I am informed there are plenty of loaded ones still down forward.      Lieut.-Commander Wainwright, who is in direct charge of the exploration, is indefatigable.      The divers have been investigating to-day into the causes of the explosion, exploring the forward part of the                              94 hull and getting into the ward room aft.      A delicate question will be:  What is in the interior; and what is on the exterior?      Thus far the Spanish have only granted permission to examine the interior.      No Spanish diver has gone below in the wreck yet.      The divers’ work necessarily is extremely slow, and dangerous too, owing to the upheaval of the forward part of the ship.      The big cranes are expected to get the large obstructions out of the way quickly.                   BIG WRECKING OPERATIONS.      The Board of Investigation is preparing the big wrecking tug Right Arm so that Capt. Magee can proceed to lift portions of the wreck.      The tug has the biggest hoisting cable afloat, and the largest engines ever built at Providence, R.I.  She has also six pumps, each with its own boiler and each having 30-inch suction.  She could pump out a vessel the size of the Spanish cruiser Alfonso XII. in seven hours.      Her Captain is proud of the boat and apparently is a very capable man.      The men of the crew are very willing on this occasion.      These tug's cranes are of fifteen tons capacity, but they can raise the twenty-five-ton guns by means of the massive anchor chain referred to.                  STRAIN TELLING ON SIGSBEE.      The strain is telling upon Capt. Sigsbee.  He can’t sleep well.  Friends are trying to get his mind off from the disaster.      Two more bodies were found to-day.  Neither was identified.           STILL SEARCHING FOR JENKINS AND MERRITT.      The bodies of Jenkins and Merritt have not been found yet.  Much wreckage must be got out first.      Jenkins’s state room was entered and some personal effects were taken out.      His body is thought to be in the junior officer’s mess room, where the hero probably “met the water,” as Lieut. Holman says, while blindly going toward his station forward. He was a noble fellow and, as the Maine’s intelligence officer, had got Havana’s bearings “down very fine.”      Almost all the bodies which have been seen in the forward part of the wreck, have arms upstretched and extended fingers in the exact position of reaching for the handles to jump out of the hammocks, when suddenly awakened 95 by the first shock and being then caught.      Admiral Manterola, in command of the Spanish naval forces in Cuban waters, called to-day on the officers of the Fern.
