WORLD WAR CORRESPONDENT LANDED NEAR SANTIAGO.                             -----           Found that the Spaniards Are Removing the            Merrimac Wreck—Guns Fired at the Fleet—                  Sampson Anxious for Troops.            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)           The World, Saturday, June 11, 1898, p. 1      ON BOARD THE WORLD DESPATCH-BOAT TRITON, PORT ANTONIO, Jamaica, June 10.—I landed from The World despatch-boat near Santiago yesterday.  Neither Spaniards nor insurgents could be seen.      I learned that the Spaniards are trying to destroy the wreck of the Merrimac, which was sunk in the channel at such great risk by Lieut. Hobson and his gallant men.  The masts and the stack of the Merrimac have disappeared.      Not all of the guns of Santiago were silenced by the terrific fire of our fleet.  Two of them were fired at the fleet yesterday.      Admiral Sampson is impatient over the non-arrival of troops at Guantanamo, where the outer harbor has been seized for their landing.      A report has been made to the Admiral that a Spanish warship has been sighted off the north coast of Cuba.  He discredits it.
