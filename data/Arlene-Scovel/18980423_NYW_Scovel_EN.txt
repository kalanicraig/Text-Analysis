SAMPSON’S BIG FLEET INVESTS HAVANA.-----Twelve Warships of the Great Fleet, at 5.30 P.M., Inside the Range of Morro Light, Fifteen Miles from Havana. -----CAPT. SAMPSON REPORTED TO HAVECAPTURED A SPANISH SHIP.-----Left the Fleet Mysteriously at 5 P.M. and Sailed Eastward— the Prize, It Is Said, Will Be Brought to Key West. -----(Special from a Staff Correspondent on Board The World Despatch boat Triton, Accompanying theUnited States Fleet to Havana.)           The World, Saturday, April 23, 1898. p. 1      KEY WEST, April 23.—At 5:30 P.M. yesterday twelve United States war vessels had penetrated three miles inside the range of Morro light.      They were not over fifteen miles from Havana.      In a beautifully correct single line of battle the powerful Iowa and Indiana were flanked by the Cincinnati, Detroit, Machias, Nashville, Castino, Wilmington and the monitor Amphitrite, with her crew of expert gunners.      Two torpedo-boats followed.  Two more were there, but invisible on the flanks.      It was a squadron without a flagship.  The big, high fighter, carrying the commander-in-chief and the signal flags, mysteriously left its ranks half an hour before.      At 5 o’clock sharp the New York turned about and steamed east, paralleling the Cuban coast.      The Mayflower and the newspaper flotilla followed.      An incoming tug reports that the New York has captured a Spanish passenger steamer plying between Havana and Porto Rico.      The torpedo fleet is coming in.      Havana will be delirious to-night.  An English accent will be a dangerous possession.
