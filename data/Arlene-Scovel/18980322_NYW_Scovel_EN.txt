A FINAL SUMMARY OF NAVAL COURT’S FACTS AND EVIDENCE -----The World’s War Correspondent, Who WitnessedThe Maine Explosion, and Whose News Has Been All Along the Most Accurate Cabled from Havana. -----(Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World, Sent from Havana to Key West by The World’s Despatch Steamer Triton.)         On Board The World’s Despatch Steamer Triton.           The World, Tuesday, March 22, 1898, p. 4                                     Havana Harbor, March 21.      Here are all the facts of the Maine calamity, in comprehensive form, as they were gathered by The World, from the time the explosion shook Havana until the American Naval Court of Inquiry left here full of facts and expert testimony, and, in fact, up to the present time.      They are not matters of hearsay: they are not figments of the imagination.  They are cold facts in iron and steel and flesh.      When George Bronson Rea and I reached the wreck, with Havana’s Chief of Police, Col. Paglieri at 10 o’clock on the night of Feb. 15, we found Capt. Sigsbee just stepping from the still dry quarter-deck into his gig.      Our first question was:      “Did the magazines go up?”     CAPT. SIGSBEE’S ONLY STATEMENT WAS MADE TO THE WORLD.      Capt. Sigsbee, then in the supreme moments of a captain’s agony, gave the only bit of information he has ever given.  He said:      “It is impossible that the magazines could explode.”      If the big twenty-five ton powder room forward was intact everybody knew that the other small magazines forward could not alone have annihilated that part of the ship; something must have helped.  The thing was to prove the condition of that one big deposit of explosives.      Daybreak the next morning showed a condition of affairs which each succeeding day has only seemed to clinch.  We noticed:      FIRST—That everything movable or wrenched apart had been thrown from the left side of the ship to the right side.      Had the big magazine gone everything would have moved 193 just the other way.  It was on the right side of the ship and, although nobody can lay down a law for the exact direction an explosion of steam or powder will take, anybody knows that nothing would approach twenty-tons of powder in the act of explosion.      SECOND—That the rear part of the wreck canted to port, exactly as it would if it had been struck and fractured from that side.      THIRD—That three men had been sleeping in the ship’s cutter moored to the starboard boom not thirty feet from the big magazine.  Had this exploded the very rush of gas, it seemed, would have killed those men.  Yet they were little hurt and two left for Key West the next morning.      FOURTH—That another man had been sleeping over the 6- inch service magazine forward and still survived.  Although this powder-holder was too far forward to produce the effects observed, yet the incident tended to prove that not even it had exploded.      FIFTH—That the rear visible portion of the Maine had been slewed away from its known position at the time of the explosion: by some great force applied from the left.         HAVANA’S WATER FRONT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRECKED.      SIXTH—That filled, unexploded 10-inch powder cases were brought up from the vicinity of the big magazine. The highest experts here said it would be impossible for several such packages of 125 pounds each to explode without all in the magazine exploding, and that if they did the magazines aft as well as all the forward magazines would go off, the Maine would completely disappear and the Havana water front would be badly wrecked. No debris fell upon the nearest point—the Machina. A few gas lamps put out and a few mirrors broken by the shock were the only signs of the Maine disaster on shore in any direction except from port to starboard. In that direction articles were thrown a quarter of a mile into Casa Blanca—another indication of a stroke on the port side.      SEVENTH—Divers found the floor of the magazine and large portions of the walls practically intact.      EIGHTH—The 10-inch shells which had been stacked between the 10-inch powder-room and the reserve magazine were found thrown, unexploded, into the powder-room from left to right.      NINTH—There were many such shells in the loading-room, just above the powder.  Had it exploded Havana’s water front would have been covered with fragments of them.               EVIDENCE OF INNER EXPLOSION, TOO. TENTH—Both ten-inch and six-inch powder cases were found 194 empty, burned and discolored.  Experts said they might have exploded, but they might also have gained such an appearance from an exterior force and fire.  Some plainly had been split open by pressure upon the ends.  This raises suspicions of an interior explosion.      ELEVENTH—It was discovered that the reserve magazine (containing saluting powder) probably did explode, and that empty powder cases of both sizes were kept there.  Experts said the ton of black powder stored there could not alone have so eaten up the ship.  By this time the innocence of the big magazines had been thoroughly determined and it had been discovered also that there might have been a few loaded six-inch shells in the reserve magazine which would aid in the general destruction to some extent and would account for some of the apparently exploded six-inch cases found.      TWELFTH—The boiler explosion theory was finally dismissed, because the boilers under steam that night were found intact in the part of the ship remaining whole.      THIRTEENTH—The spontaneous combustion of coal theory was thrown out, for the coal itself was found by divers intact and unburned—so solid, in fact, as to be mistaken for the turret in the preliminary soundings.      FOURTEENTH—The gun-cotton explosion theory had been dismissed long before, as the gun-cotton was stored in the after, intact portion of the wreck.      FIFTEENTH—The electric contact theory was not considered, because where the wires went through the coal bunkers the coal was found undamaged and no wires touched the magazines.                 TESTIMONY OF THE TURRET TOP.      SIXTEENTH—The turret was found with its thin top unburned.  Had the big magazine under it exploded the top would have been ripped open or blown to splinters.      SEVENTEENTH—Much of the fixed ammunition discovered in this magazine was immediately forward of the big ten-inch powder room, big-shell room and the reserve magazines.  The second explosion was just between these and the six-inch service magazine away forward in the very eyes of the ship. Most of the cartridges found were whole but some were exploded.  All had primers in them: evidently some had been hit thereon and some had not.  Much of the exploded six- pounder and one-pounder ammunition probably was what remained of the liberal supply of it that the alert Capt. Sigsbee had about the decks for ready use in case of a night attack.  The fact was fixed that but little destructive force had come from the “fixed ammunition” 195 magazine.               THE BOTTOM PLATE TOLD THE STORY.      EIGHTEENTH—A protruding plate was identified completely as being a bottom plate from the port side of the keel about frame No. 17 from the bow to the stern and at about the ship’s second longitudinal and second fore and aft keel, counting from the middle of the bottom toward the port side.  This plate and the corresponding plate of the Maine’s inner bottom were proved to have been driven upward by some tremendous force which could not have come from the interior of the ship, for into the same interior, as well as upward, had they been driven.  They had, however, been close to the reserve magazine and the shock which tore them up seemed to have detonated the primers of the several boxes of loaded brass saluting cartridges which that iron room contained and that explosion seemed to have fired the ton of powder stored there also.  Just such an occurrence would have given to the bottom plate its peculiar curl outward.      The discovery of these plates was cabled to The World two days before any other newspaper mention of them reached New York.  They seemed to absolutely clinch all previous evidence that the Maine had been torpedoed or mined against the port bottom, well forward, as was cabled to The World three days after the explosion when the direction and force of the explosion upon every visible thing seemed fairly to cry out.      NINETEENTH—The American Navy divers found that the bodies forward of the rear magazines were not mangled by the explosion, but all were, with arms up stretched toward the beams over their hammocks, in an evident effort to jump out.  This seemed to confirm the double explosion testified to by passengers of the steamer City of Washington first to The World and then to the Court of Inquiry.  The men were caught by the rushing in of the water—then the big explosion broke up the ship—too quickly for them to more than reach upward.      TWENTIETH—The Spanish divers confirmed the American Navy divers’ discoveries up to that time.          POSITION OF THE RAM LEFT NO ROOM FOR DOUBT.      TWENTY-FIRST—The navy men made the startling discovery that the Maine was broken in two from a blow against the port side as The World first mentioned.  The ram was found out of line, and the Spanish divers found the starboard bow anchor just where it should be had the ship slewed about from a shock.  The navy divers found the port bow anchor in its proper relative position.  The peculiar direction of 196 the intact portion of the wreck was then explained.  The mooring chain aided in holding the ram and part of the bow in the original position, while other parts of the ship were blown off to one side.      TWENTY-SECOND—The Spanish divers found the Maine’s starboard bow intact from under the bow anchor to “the dead lights,” or within forty feet of the point of the ram. They claim to have found a big hole where the extreme bow and the ram ought to be.  This was their discovery of yesterday.  It simply confirms the American divers’ work.      These facts are hastily thrown together without time for reference to memorandums made day by day.  There have been many other discoveries by The World.      To disprove the Spanish accusation of carelessness, which alone could have allowed an interior explosion which could demolish the ship, we have Capt. Sigsbee’s record, his coolness in trying situations and the fact of his coming into Havana with ammunition hoists in readiness, gun cylinders filled and turrets manned—simply prepared for emergencies.  Other indications of his watchfulness were the double guard constantly kept and the fact that no visitor was allowed aboard unattended.      As to the splendid discipline of the crew I need but to note the individual actions of a few survivors, such as Bill Anthony’s “Sir, I have to inform you that the ship has been blown up and is sinking,” others marines loading rifles first at the explosion and for orders afterward, &c.      Had the Maine blown herself up the indicative facts must surely have leaked out, even if not discovered by the newspaper investigations.  The members of the Court of Inquiry, had they known it, surely would have so stated to allay the great popular excitement and save the Government vast sums of money.                 SPANISH REPORT WILL CONFLICT.      The members of the Spanish Board of Investigation frankly say they will report interior causes, but do not and cannot explain why except to claim that no fish were killed and no water was seen blown into the air.  As to fish, there are few about the spot of the wreck.  No dead bodies have shone their marks.  I learn from an expert who has blown up many wrecks that even with fish abounding only the few immediately on contact would really have been killed, that most of them seen are only stunned and come to life readily and disappear, and that there always are fewer fish about the clean bottom of a recently docked iron man- of-war than about the weed grown [. . .]      Capt. Sigsbee has known the course of the court’s                              197 investigations.  It seems incredible that he could recover his health so rapidly and keep cheerful did he feel that the court would render a verdict of “accidental cause” and so end his brilliant career, for he says:      “America does not keep captains to lose battle-ships!”      In short, not one fact has appeared to point to interior explosion alone as annihilating the forward portion of the Maine.      As to columns of water, experts declare that if a torpedo or a mine were exploded so far under the ship as the second longitudinal, or only a few feet from the keel, there would not necessarily be much water raised, particularly if the explosion were almost immediately counteracted by an inside explosion—as of a reserve magazine. There are fifty great and five hundred small things, physical and logical, which show that the battle-ship Maine was hit hard from the outside. Whether by a mine or torpedo is the thing for Spain to explain.
