Thirteen hours ago, at daybreak, saw the happiest, tiredest seventeen men afloat, looking over the vessel’s stern at a dwindling coast.  Five hours and twenty-three minutes of the supremest toll and keenest anxiety had been endured.  The men were The World correspondents, officers and crew of The World’s famous despatch boat Triton.      From 11 P.M. Tuesday until 4:30 A.M. Wednesday the big tug had been hard aground on the north coast of Cuba.  We were one mile from a Spanish fort and less than thirty from Havana.  We were helpless.  Unarmed and immovable, our seventeen men and the valuable boat were at the mercy of any three Spanish peasant boys with Mausers, or any one little coast patrol launch fast enough to get out of its own way.  Neither Spanish cruiser nor patrol boat nor soldier came.      The continuous full speed astern of the steamer’s powerful triple expansion engines, and hour after hour of tremendous strain on a towing hawser, fast to a 1,200-pound anchor astern, had done their work.  The Triton was snatched from Spain by hard, swift, quiet work.  It was done by triple pressure American “hustle.”  An apparently hopeless situation was triumphed over by the same resourceful energy, by the ability to do things quickly which puts the American sailor and soldier above his fellows.      Frenchmen would have got the anchor down quickly, but in the wrong place; Germans would still be hoisting coal, “by the numbers;” Englishmen would have said “Let’s stick to the ship, mates,” and principally made ready to fight. 252 But the Triton’s crew just “hustled,” and how they did it!                   HINTS FROM CAPT. SAMPSON.      Yesterday morning we boarded the flagship New York, carefully, to receive Commander-in Chief Sampson’s last intimation as to what he would not object to knowing about Cuba’s northern coast.  At noon we steamed south.  Making the Cuban coast about midnight we expected to pick up the courageous World courier Heilberg, who, as already cabled last Saturday night, safely reached Havana city through Spain’s new batteries under Morro lighthouse.  He has most important information for the Government, and carried for The World readers the uncensored despatches of its special correspondent in Havana, giving the interesting truth of what has happened in that sealed city since its American exodus.      The night was starlit, the horizon moderately clear, with the wind from the southeast.  The Cuban northern waters were unusually calm.  With lights out the Triton approached the coast, and proper landmarks were picked up. In case of war, and from World information, weather-driven American torpedo-boats can now gain many snug little shelters by the same means.      Our position on the coast determined, and well out from shore, the Triton steamed west at full speed until the requisite number of four-minute periods had marked the proper number of miles to the point where Heilberg was to be in waiting.  Then at one-third speed we put in toward the dark strip of coast.  No Spanish cruisers had been sighted.      The engines stopped, and the big, throbbing silent tug rippled closer.      Heilberg was not there.  Nobody swore.  No one complained, for the crew had seen him land last Saturday night.  Some of them had rowed him ashore, and all hands knew that if not at the appointed place Heilberg was dead, captured, wounded, or that events of such importance were happening in Havana as to keep him there.  I hope to have him and his information in Key West within the week.      For fear that the daring courier might have missed the proper point, we turned the Triton’s bow toward Havana and steamed along at half speed.  We strained our eyes through powerful binoculars, but no figure was relieved by the beach’s white sand.  The shore grew misty, as if receding. I said: “Keep her as close in as you dare, Capt. Chase.”                   THE TRITON GOES AGROUND.      The Triton’s nose poked more inward, when suddenly, right on our port bow, the shore shot up distinct and clear                              253 and right upon us.  The mist had lifted at the same instant that we struck the sunken reef.  We were going very slowly, and the first tremble set all bells and gongs in the engine-room shouting “Back her wide open!”  But the heavy boat rose twice and then settled firmly.  The coral rocks grip as with fangs.      The Spanish fort was almost visible up the hill, and the engine bells had made a pandemonium of racket.  No one spoke.  The big engines ground and the propeller churned water into yeast.  No motion.  Hardly a tremble.  We were fast.  Then the men realized it all.  They knew how little Spain just now wished the landing places to be located for American vessels or landing places to be selected for American troops.  But they kept quiet.      The temperature of the engine and fire rooms had risen to 150 or 160 degrees.  But the firemen and engineers stayed at their posts.  No window could be opened for fear of showing light.  A coast patrol boat was expected at any moment, but the Triton’s officers didn’t stop to figure on the probabilities.  They worked.  Correspondents, Photographer Hare, of Collier’s Weekly, and all the spare hands went at the deck load of coal.  Two-hundred-pound bags flew like footballs.  Every few moments I looked up to see if the Spanish soldiers had been brought down by the heavy splashing.  Thirty tons went, but the Triton was pitifully solid as ever.                   HEROIC WORK FOR LIBERTY.      Meanwhile Mate Benjamin began unshackling the big anchor.  The large life-boat was got down as quickly as possible, and with the big stern lantern rigged into a bull’s eye lamp the delicate and difficult work was begun of putting the half-ton anchor into a twenty-foot skiff, so as not to sink it while being loaded or upset it while being dropped to proper position.  In broad daylight in New York Harbor it would have been a difficult job.  But they did it.  The boat dropped to the stern and the big twin hawser was carefully made fast.  Poor work would have lost both anchor and tug.  Double purchase blocks were rigged. The boat pulled away to stern and off to starboard; 400 feet away the anchor was dumped over and the rear capstan strained at the big line.  The engines churned back again. No movement.  It was nearly 1 A.M. when the discovery was made that the tide was falling.  Hope vanished, but the crew kept at it.  Blocks were fastened to the cable and taken to the most powerful forward windlass.  It rattled and puffed, but the soldiers did not come and neither did the Triton. 254      Now Chief Engineer Trivett set all hands laboriously hoisting coal in buckets from the bunkers.  The iron blocks were so hot that they burned, but the sailors kept at it.      About 3 A.M. the capstan was grinding and the engines throbbing, when the Triton gave a gentle bump upon her coral chocks.  Blaisdell said:      “The tide’s coming!”      A soft ground swell came in about 4 A.M.  The wind was changing.  The bump became slightly more decided.  The Triton could be got off in a few hours.  But forty minutes meant daylight, and that meant plain sight from the Spanish fort, capture, confiscation and Cabanas.      The World correspondent knew that clearing the ship of themselves and all naval notes, photographic apparatus, plans, &c., would leave her officers more apparent grounds for explanation.  We took the smaller of the boats, and with two sailors prepared to strike out north across the gulf.  We had reason to believe that a United States cruiser might be found half way.  If not we meant to keep on to Key West, weather and strength permitting.                  AT LAST THE TRITON IS FREE.      Capt. Chase could then, if boarded, show clean papers and perfectly innocent crew and cargo.  The engineers, sailors and firemen, almost to a man, decided to stick to the ship.  They felt that even Cabanas would not be for long, with the American Navy soon to arrive off Havana. Few of them wanted to go ashore.      It was now 4.15.  Dawn was beginning to break as we said good-bye to the haggard, coal blackened, brave officers and crew.  We began to row north.  If the Triton came off after daylight and escaped, she was to pick us up out in the stream.      The rudder became unshipped.  It took some time to rehook it.  Then the field glass was discovered to have been forgotten.  We turned, rowed back toward the Triton. We saw her roll slightly.      Then her engines suddenly stopped and her highly- stocked boilers roared through the saf[e]ty valves, and higher than the clanking windless and rushing steam, came the shout:      “Come aboard, boys, we’re off.”      The tide had risen, and four hours of high-pressure steam upon the propeller and anchor had won.  The Spanish soldiers must have heard the finale to our labors of the night.  Nobody cared.  Capt. Chase spun the wheel about to port, the Triton swung on her heel, the safety valve ceased roaring as the steam found its work to do, and seventeen 255 happy, haggard men shook hands together.
