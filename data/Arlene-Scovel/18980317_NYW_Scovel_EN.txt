CONGOSTO THOUGHT TO HAVE PLOTTED FOR LEE'S RECALL.                             -----     Blanco's Secretary-General Has Been Unable to Dictate          to the United States Consul-General, and Is        Not Admired by Spaniards, Cubans or Americans.       (Special from a World Staff Correspondent.  Sent            from Havana to Key West by The World's                 Dispatch Steamer Confidence.)       On Board The World's Dispatch Steamer Confidence.            The World, Monday, March 17, 1898, p. 2                                     Havana Harbor, March 13.      Spain did request Consul-General Lee's recall unofficially, it now comes to light, and then denied it when the matter became public.      Basing his action on Gen. Lee's opinions regarding the farcical nature autonomy, as has been cabled to The World fully, Senor Ambler took up the cause of the Autonomist Cabinet, or, as it is called here, "The Cabinet of the Autonomatonists, which he thought had been slighted.  He wrote to his friend Moret, the Spanish Colonial Secretary, whom he persuaded to intimate to Washington that Gen. Lee's recall would be agreeable to Spain.      President McKinley replied vigorously that Gen. Lee was here to stay.      The general impression here is that General Secretary Congosto was at the bottom of the whole affair.  He can do nothing with Gen. Lee, even by writing to him decoy notes, as has been cabled, to which Gen. Lee's answer would furnish ammunition to be used against him.      From the moment of the disaster the Maine's officers have been disgusted with Congosto.  Their messages, they say, were mysteriously held, and on any matter involving a discussion between the State Department and the Spanish Legation Congosto's telegraph somehow always got through in time for Charge d'Affaires Du Bosc in Washington to rush to the State Department and get promises which proved only advantageous in gaining time for Spain, when Capt. Sigsbee's or Lee's advices on the same subject got to the Secretary of State or of the Navy.      Neither Spaniards, Cubans nor American admire Congosto.  He does not seem to be the man for his important position.  Almost all of Gen. Blanco's American views are 171 obtained through Congosto's eyes.      The local press is full of reiterated statements of the friendliness of President McKinley to Spain.  It says Senor Du Bosc considers the latest incident favorably closed. COURT'S WORK IN HAVANA IS FINISHED.                             -----       Leading Member, Being Asked by The World's Staff            Correspondent if the Board Expected to               Return, Answered, “We Hope Not.”                             -----         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)           The World, Thursday, March 17, 1898, p. 2                                      Havana, Cuba, March 16.      The general impression here is that the Naval Court of Inquiry will not return to Havana unless the divers make some great unexpected discovery.      Naval officers generally think the court's verdict should reach the Navy Department inside of ten days, as the points which will be included in it were thoroughly discussed as they came up, and there should be no necessity for a prolonged deliberation after all the evidence is in.      A leading member of the court said to me just before leaving, in answer to my question if he and his colleagues expected to return:      “We hope not.”      Another member intimated rather than said that after a week of taking additional testimony and reviewing the mass already in hand the court might have to return to Havana to hear the testimony of the divers in regard to their last gleanings.      Capt. Sampson expects to hold court upon the battle- ship Iowa.  As the ship is six miles off shore the court's doings will be easily kept secret and nothing at all will be learned of its deliberations or intentions.      Drawings of the results of the divers' investigations will be sent to the court at Key West within two or three days.  They are practically completed, but Ensign Powelson wishes to get more conclusive measurements.  Until he has them he will not be satisfied with his work, which has been arduous and creditable both to the Construction Department, in which he first worked, and to the line which he afterward joined.      He prefers sea service to the constructor's draughting board.  So well-equipped and well-balanced an officer would handle a torpedo-boat splendidly in case of need.      In addition to the portion of a body found by the Montgomery's men, another was brought up yesterday.  Both were unrecognizable.  A third has been located below the 183 surface of the water.      Commander Converse has not left his ship yet except for ceremonial visits.      The Court of Inquiry has no piece of submarine cable with conductors.  I am able to state this authoritatively.      The articles the tug Merritt's dredging anchor brought up were principally rigging and ropes.  The bit of cable found was identified immediately as belonging to the ship's equipment.  The Maine had regular submarine cables on board for use in counter-mining.  No mistake about this is possible.      The court is satisfied that nothing of a kind to indicate a mine has been found.  The finding of pieces of cable was reported to The World several days ago.  The wire mentioned probably was a piece of heavily insulated electric [. . .] running to the masthead and used to light the signal lanterns. 

184     SPAIN’S OWN DIVERS POSITIVELY PROVE WORLD DISCOVERY.                             -----        Though Sent Down to Find the Maine’s Ram Where       It Ought to Be, They Report Again that It Points           Away from the Rest of the Shattered Ship.                             -----    LATEST SPANISH THEORY TO ACCOUNT FOR INSIDE EXPLOSION.                             -----           (From One of The World’s Staff of Special   Correspondents in Cuba.  Sent from Havana to Key West by                The World’s Despatch Steamer.)       On Board The World’s Despatch Steamer Confidence,           The World, Thursday, March 17, 1898, p. 2                                     Havana Harbor, March 16.      Spain’s own divers corroborate The World’s report of the position of the Maine’s ram.  They find the bow of the ship pointing nearly east, while the remainder of the wreck points almost south.      They thought they had discovered this the first time they descended in the place where The World’s men had been seen measuring and sounding. But when their employers objected strongly to that report, knowing full well that it was absolute proof of an exterior explosion, the divers again sought the Maine’s bow, where it ought to be if the ship is unbroken and untwisted.      As I cabled, they then found an anchor and thought the bow was there.  But when the Maine’s plans—always open to their inspection showed that the anchor was sixty feet back of the bow, and when they found nothing but mud—as The World had already discovered—where this sixty feet of bow and ram ought to be, then they started around again to port.                MAINE POSITIVELY BROKEN IN TWO.      Yesterday afternoon they told their officers that the Maine surely was broken in two—that they were convinced they had found her bow where first they thought it was.      These men tell truth to their superiors.  And as The World is able to produce competent sworn testimony as to what their reports actually have been, it will be most interesting to see how near to their men’s truthful statements the Spanish board of investigation will keep in their patriotic efforts to show an innocent cause for the Maine horror at variance with every present known fact. 185 The American court left for Key West yesterday too early to receive this last and most important corroborative Spanish testimony, but it is at the court’s disposal.      And now it seems almost beyond the peradventure of doubt that the capable, patriotic gentlemen of the United States Court of Inquiry will forget Wall street, will remember only their duty and the evidence presented and will report to the Government what our navy divers and the Spanish divers find, what the American navy experts declare, and what the Maine above water tells to every tourist visitor—that our battle-ship was blown up, that very likely her reserve magazine’s ton of powder aided, but of itself could not change the ship’s position nor cause so great damage.  In short, that the Maine was hit by something strong.              QUESTION STILL IS: MINE OR TORPEDO?      The question is the same now as for the past three weeks.  Was it a mine or a torpedo?      The only vestige of proof of a mine seems to be the heavy secret shipments of dynamite and the reported finding of submarine cables.  The World’s investigation shows that the explosives sent here were used openly, and that the insulated wires found have been identified positively as having belonged to the ship.      The only conjecture seemingly in harmony with all this observed phenomena undisputed by anybody, as has been cabled to The World, attributes the initial explosion to a boiler shell torpedo submerged and towed by a rope.      The Spanish officials and press continue giving wonderful causes of an interior explosion.  The last is that the paymaster’s stores exploded and set off the adjacent six-inch service magazine, which detonated the others and the Maine pulverized herself, molasses and tomatoes fomented and did the damage.      This theory is based on the finding of battered tin cans in the wreck.      On the day when the Spanish divers thought they had found the Maine’s box in its proper position I tried to cable that fact.  It certainly was not detrimental to Spain, and was rather in their favor.  But the censor cut it out.  Why did he do it?
