GOMEZ WRITES OF MAINE'S FATE AND SPAIN'S WAR OF REVENGE. -----Says Peace of the World is Menaced by Continuanceof Spanish Methods in Cuba, and Lasting PeaceNot Possible Except Through Freedom.-----(Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World. Sent from Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer.) On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Triton. The World, Monday, March 28, 1898, p. 2                                     Havana Harbor, March 27. Here is Gen. Gomez's first letter after learning of the blowing up of the Maine.      It is the first authentic news from the insurgent Commander-in-Chief since The World correspondent, armed with a pass from Captain-General Blanco, saw the veteran leader last December.      The letter was written to an American in Cuba who had sent to the General the full details, all the theories and a statement of the possible effects of the Maine affair, and had requested an opinion from Cuba's long-headed chief.      Although the American is a warm personal friend of Gen. Gomez, he received no answer to his Maine questions except the intimation that Spain or Spaniards blew up the ship, realizing the hopelessness of their Cuban affairs.      The letter is characteristic of old Gen. Gomez.  He seldom opines and never prophesies.  The letter reads:                     GEN. GOMEZ'S LETTER.                                  “Las Villas, March 9, 1898. “Dear Sir and Friend: It is very agreeable for me to answer your favor of the 20th the contents of which amuse me and gave me great pleasure.      “Spain's impotence to subdue this revolution, either by military force or by political action, is clearly shown by the recent events, while our determinations and purposes have been too widely proclaimed and too well proved to require that I should reassert them here, much less to a person, like your good self, who has formed a complete judgment by his own experience and knowledge of the respective situations of both belligerent forces.      “At the state which affairs have reached now, every man of sense understands that Spain's continuing of this war is iniquitous, inhumane and a menace to the peace of 209 the world.  No just or noble end is pursued now; the object is to kill and destroy for revenge.      “The great American Republic is destined to intervene sooner or later in some way to stop the Cuban war, but her mediation can only bring permanent peace if Cuba obtains absolute independence.      “On that basis and the payment of several millions as indemnity it is possible that our Government would treat of peace with Spain.      “That is the unanimous feeling of the Cuban people, particularly of the Army of Liberation, which I have the honor to command.      “With the highest esteem, consideration and friendship, I am yours, the Commander-in-Chief. “GOMEZ.”               NEITHER AUTONOMY NOR ANNEXATION.      What Cuba's chieftain really means to say—and what I know he feels strongly—is this:      The Cubans in the field desire annexation as little as they do autonomy.  They have fought three years for independence, three years of horribly uphill war, and they want nothing less.  Their flag has become a reality to them and they wish no other.  Their proper desire is like that of other Americans in 1776.  It by no means contemplates that the United States should conquer Cuba after defeating Spain, which is what would have to be done if the United States should annex Cuba.      I am informed that Gen. Calixto Garcia has the same idea on this subject as has Gen. Gomez. If annexed Cuba would be an awfully troublesome white elephant for twenty years. Both Gen. Gomez and Gen. Blanco have said in effect to The World:      “If you had Cuba there is not a single American statesman who would know what to do with it.”      Consideration of this point is unnecessary, since commercial association only is what the United States wish. That would naturally follow Cuba's independence.  Besides, it has been guaranteed in signed statements to The World from Gen. Gomez and Gen. Maceo.      The moment Spain evacuates the island the Cuban republic will need money for schools, roads, current expenses and to pay pensions and the dollar a day for three years of hard-earned but so far only imaginary pay of the Cuban soldiers.             CUBA WOULD PLEDGE TO US HER COMMERCE.      The United States would be that natural lender.  By lending and by accepting control of the Cuban customs to 210 secure the loan the United States would have commercial Cuba, while the Cubans would have political Cuba and their flag from the beginning and later, when the loan has been repaid to the United States, Cuba would be independent in fact as well as in name.      Both Gen. Gomez and Gen. Maceo agreed in writing to recommend such concessions to the United States.  Both promises were given in 1896, at the height of a successful invasion when Cuban success seemed certain to be a matter of only six months.      The Cubans are more favorable to this style of an American protectorate now than they were then.      Outright annexation of Cuba would be wrong, would be foolish.      A protectorate as outlined would be acceptable to the Cubans and would give the United States all the benefits annexation could bring and few of its vexations. 211           SPANISH SAY AMERICANS MUST LEAVE HAVANA.                             -----        At the Palace War Is Certainly Expected and an         Inflammatory Circular Invites Loyal Spaniards                  to “Kill the Yankee Pigs.”  (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World, Sent from  Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer Triton.)         On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Triton.            The World, Monday, March 28, 1898, p. 2                                     Havana Harbor, March 27.      At last the Spanish Government of Cuba expects war with the United States.  The officials openly say so.  I know that a staff officer close to Blanco said:      “All you Americans will have to leave Havana in a few days.  No special edict will be made about correspondents, all will go together.”      The American colony is prepared to move into the harbor on short notice. The elections are now progressing quietly under a heavy guard. If there is trouble the little fleet of little vessels composed of the Fern, Mangrove and Bache will be jammed to overflowing.      There are about eight hundred United States citizens here, of whom about one hundred are native born Americans. How they are to be even herded aboard the three little vessels is a problem.      In the political section of the palace the whispers of war have changed to direct frank admissions that it must be and will come in a few days.  All this is before the report of the board is finally known and is said by men who have constantly claimed that no war with the United States could arise from Cuban questions or the Maine horror, or both together.      That Sagasta has made up his mind to do what Canovas would have done months ago is seemingly indisputable.      As one of the highest Spanish authorities said this morning, neither Sagasta nor McKinley is able to withstand the clamor for war of both their peoples.  The Cubans here naturally hope for any struggle which will make their own the shorter, and now all Havana considers an American- Spanish war certain.      No great outflow of Americans has yet started from 212 Havana.  The one little Plant steamer is still able to accommodate the bi-weekly traffic between here and Key West.      But when something happens no one knows where the refugees are to go to.      A most remarkable incendiary circular was put out yesterday, calling upon all good Spaniards to assemble to- day in the public square and kill the big Yankee pigs responsible for the war, represented by Lee, and the little pigs of correspondents also.      The World correspondent was particularly honored by a personal assault as an aide on Gomez's staff and a defamer of Spain.      Such a heavy guard is now over the square and the recent developments were so quick that the lower element has not yet had time for an uprising.      No disturbance has taken place up to the present hour, and none is likely to-day.      American food was started out in a train of fourteen box-cars to Matanzas, Sagua and Cienfuegos.      To-day Klopsch's diet kitchen and dispensary were opened.  They will feed two thousand from the central distributing stations.  They are now feeding three thousand daily. 213 AMERICANS IN HAVANA ARE IN GREAT DANGER.                             -----     Rumor that United States Have Told Spain to End Cuban       War Causes Great Excitement in the Cuban Capital.                             -----    (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World, Sent   from Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer.)                 On Board The World's Despatch                Steamer Triton, Havana Harbor, The World, Monday, March 28, 1898, p. 2Havana, March 26, by way of Tampa, Fla., March 27.      Havana is at a white heat over a report that the United States have demanded that Spain end the war in Cuba. Trouble is looked for.      The Spaniards here are too ignorantly patriotic to be cowed.  They are of a brave race and they do not understand the power of the 70,000,000 people and the untold millions of money of the United States. They see in the harbor the Maine, a pitiful wreck, the insignificant Fern and the splendid Spanish warships the Vizcaya, and the Oquendo. They feel that they would be equal, if not superior, in a conflict, and as nothing could be worse than present prostration they welcome even the prospect of a battle for a change.      Americans here have never been in such danger as they are to-day.      Ignorant, prejudiced and cruel, the armed Volunteers refuse still to be coerced by Blanco into giving up their rifles for deposit in a common armory.  Indeed, it is said that the armory cannot be finished for a year.      The Volunteers are now more dangerous than ever. Inflammatory circulars are becoming genuine Spanish-written documents.  They are growing vulgar which is a sure sign of Spanish middle-class authorship, and they insult American loan women, wives of American Congressmen, and correspondents now of [. . .] in Havana.      It is not unlikely that the presence of an American here may within thirty hours bring war in fact.
