MAINE THE FIRST SHIP MOORED TO THE FATAL BUOY. -----Capt. Rouse, for Years a Frequent Visitor to HavanaIn Command of Steamers, Often WonderedWhy No Vessel Was Ever AllowedTo Lie in That Berth.-----SIGSBEE INSISTED ON HAVING MONTGOMERY CLOSE TO VIZCAYA. -----Special from a World Staff Correspondent, sent from Havana to Key West by The World’s Despatch Steamer Confidence.)       On Board The World’s Despatch Steamer Confidence.           The World, Tuesday, March 15, 1898, p. 2                                     Havana Harbor, March 14.      I have received a very significant letter from Capt. Rouse who until ten months ago was first officer and commander for years of a Plant Line steamer running in and out of Havana harbor twice a week.  He writes:      “I have never seen a vessel of any description moored to the buoy the Maine was tied to on the night of the explosion.  I have often wondered at it.”      An energetic investigation of Capt. Rouse’s statement is now on foot.  If his observation is proved to be fact it will be tantamount to proof of a Spanish Government mine. MONTGOMERY SHIELDED BY VIZCAYA.The Spanish were greatly irritated by the way in which the Spanish cruiser Alfonso XII. was towed helplessly from buoy to buoy to make room for the American cruiser Montgomery. It was only accomplished by Capt. Sigsbee’s firmly maintained request. He wants the Montgomery to be as close as possible to the big Spanish cruiser Vizcaya. “Accidents” are less likely to happen under such a condition.      The ships ride now very close together.  Should the Montgomery blow up the pride of the Spanish Navy probably would go with her.      The Fern was formerly moored to this adjacent buoy. When the Montgomery was hourly expected and the Fern was about to sail north, Capt. Sigsbee asked that the Fern should be given an extra buoy temporarily.  This was done, but as soon as the little Fern moved, a puffing tug slowly ranged the Alfonso XII. to the coveted iron box.      Capt. Sigsbee politely but firmly protested.  The 175 Admiral thought a while, then said a mistake had been made and the Alfonso was towed back again, leaving the buoy for the American cruiser.                WOULD WANT TO GO DOWN FIGHTING.      The Montgomery’s men are a little nervous, but, as one of them said:      “We’d not mind it if we could only get a chance for one broadside afore we sank.”      It is a magnificent crew and full of pluck.      It is not yet explained here why Admiral Sicard requested Secretary Long to empty the little Fern to carry supplies to the reconcentrados, instead of the Montgomery and Nashville, as original ordered. It seems to have been either ready compliance with Spanish demands or Admiral Sicard’s fear of allowing two valuable cruisers in Spanish- controlled harbors at the same time. Now only the Montgomery is so exposed, and she is lying snugly cheek by jowl with the Vizcaya.      The littler Fern is not thought to count.               HURRYING OF FLOTILLA SIGNIFICANT.      Spain’s hurrying little torpedo boats to Cuba against the first orders and in face of the annual hurricanes is regarded here as most significant.      Japan threatened March 7 to precipitate the pending war.      The Fern has in her crew a wiry little fellow from the land of the chrysanthemum whose name is Tack.  He went ashore, got hold of much strong liquor, rode several hours about town and then belligerently refused to pay more than 20 cents.  At La Machina Wharf he broke away from the hackman and signaled enthusiastically for a boat.      The Fern’s officers saw the signal and also saw Tack vigorously lashing out at several policemen.      Being overpowered, he disappeared.  Ensign Bookwalter hurried to the rescue: found Tack still fighting around the corner, punctuating his punches with pigeon-English curses of “Spain!” and shouting:      “Me Japanese—can lick ‘em easy!”      The policemen were polite, Tack was yanked aboard ship and the “incident” was “closed.” 176         SPANISH VERDICT ON MAINE IS FIXED UP ALREADY.                             -----         Finding of the Spanish Divers Themselves Are           Ignored and the Report is Framed to Suit              The Exigencies of the Spanish Case.                             -----     (Special from a Staff Correspondent of the The World,      sent from Key West by The World Despatch Steamer.)       On Board The World’s Despatch Steamer Confidence.           The World, Tuesday, March 15, 1898, p. 2                                     Havana Harbor, March 14.      The Spanish divers have worked but little yet.  Our men say the Spaniards have slept three hours for every hour they have worked.      What they find really has no bearing on the finding of their own Court of Inquiry.  Lieut. Peral and his associates have their verdict arranged already.      But what the Spanish divers really find is of the utmost importance for the American court to possess should the American people allow the Maine question to go before an international board of investigation.      The Spanish court will cite their divers’ discoveries as evidence of interior causes.  But so far they have not indicated this.      Their achievements to date fully and marvelously confirm The World’s reports and the American divers’ interior work.  They consist of the locating of the big turret just where The World first reported its position and the raising of powder casks yet full of unexploded hexagons of brown powder.            WORLD PHOTOGRAPH UPSETS SPANISH CLAIM.      The World’s photograph of the chief Spanish diver looking intently at a handful of powder he had just taken from an intact case will be given to the American Court of Inquiry and will make it hard for the Spaniards to claim before an international board or anywhere else that the Maine’s own magazine destroyed her.  The sun proved that the Spanish know better and the American court can do likewise.      It is now determined that the Maine’s ram is off to port and the broken condition of the wreck is so pronounced that school children can see the ship was struck and smashed—not self-destroyed. 177      The Spanish divers thought they were wrong in their first report about the ram being in port.  They thought they afterward found the Maine’s bow in line and in proper condition.  In reality they are diving fully thirty-five feet aft of where the bow would be if the ship were intact.      If they should search the harbor bottom where the ram naturally should lie they would find just what The World’s soundings showed—nothing but mud and a few stray plates. Their own report confirms this statement.      They have found an anchor lashed or secured fast. Where they found it is fully 60 feet aft of the position of the anchors which were at the Maine’s bow, but it is just where the Maine’s sheet or spar anchor was fastened to her starboard upper works just forward of the big turret.  It must be this anchor, for it was the only one of the Maine’s three anchors that was lashed and no sheet anchor was carried on the port side.      If it is the starboard sheet anchor that they have found then the Spanish divers’ claim to have found the Maine’s bow intact, is disproved:                THOUGHT THEY HAD FOUND THE BOW.      The Spanish divers also thought they had found the bow by meeting a very heavy curved plate.  This they thought was the ram, but it lies exactly in the proper position of the detached “billboard” or the big piece of steel which protects the ship’s side from injury by the flake of the 7,000-pound sheet anchor.      The divers also reported a hole in the ship’s side near the anchor, a hole closed by a shutter.  This coincides with the position of the torpedo tube forward of the big turret on the starboard side, and as the wreck at that point is canted to starboard, the curve of her bottom and this hole caused the divers to think they had found the slope of the bow.      With the bow torpedo tube or hawse holes and dead lights discovered in a rof [sic], they were in the main exactly in conformity with the position of other things remarked upon.      The fact is the Spanish divers have found nothing belonging to the Maine’s tell-tale bow.  The places they have worked in are fully sixty feet back of where the bow would have to be were it where they think it is.      I cabled the Spanish ideas to The World in order to do them justice.  It is evident now that they were mistaken. The discovery by American tars of the awfully indicative ram stands as fact.      Nothing of the Maine’s forward mast has been found yet 178 by Americans.  The Spanish claim to have found a head to the left of the protruding port bottom plates.      Our men have located the port bow anchor near the twisted ram.                    A BOOMERANG DISCOVERY. The local press made a great feature of the discovery of exploded cartridge cases for six-pound fixed ammunition. They forgot that lots of this was distributed over the ship on deck for quick use in case of a night attack.      One evidence of Capt. Sigsbee’s precautions in distrusted Havana Harbor was the exploding of this extra ammunition, which the sailors of the Alfonso XII. disregarded in their manly search for mangled Maine sailors, even after ordered away by Capt. Sigsbee.      The Spanish censor is passing now upon the literary merit as well as the facts of American correspondents’ dispatches.  A short report of the routine doings of the Court of Inquiry was handed to him last night.  He poked it back with the comment, “Stupid!”  It was only news, and was not unfavorable to Spain nor an insult to Spain’s officers.      Another correspondent offered a thousand moderate words about Weyler’s sub-executioner, Fondaviela, of Ruiz fame.  The despatch was highly complimentary to Gen. Blanco, but Weyler is popular now, and as the despatch reflected upon his policy Censor Mendes cut out every page. 179          MAINE COURT MAY NOT LEAVE HAVANA THIS WEEK.                             -----        Its Members Are Impatient to Finish Their Work,       However, and Will Close Their Sessions as Soon as        They Have Obtained All the Evidence They Need.                             -----         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)              (Despatch Passed by Havana Censor.)           The World, Tuesday, March 15, 1898, p. 2                                     Havana, Cuba, March, 14.      The American Naval Court of Inquiry, judging from present indications will remain here until the latter part of this week--possibly longer.      The court was in secret session this morning reviewing the testimony.  No witness was examined. At the afternoon session Lieut.-Commander Hutchins, the executive officer of the Montgomery, was called for expert testimony, and Commander Converse, of the Montgomery, was again before the court. The members of the court seldom go ashore. They spend the time mostly on board the Mangrove.      They are much pleased with the recently received issues of the American papers, because the correspondents do not quote them as giving out information concerning the proceedings of the court.      Diver Dwyer, of the Merritt Wrecking Company, will go before the court to-morrow again.      The court convenes now earlier in the morning than heretofore, being anxious to finish its work. Capt. Chidwick visited the wreck to-day again, together with Commander Converse, of the Montgomery.      Capt. Samson, the President of the court, has entirely recovered from his recent attack of the grip. HADN'T HEARD THE IOWA IS GOING TO HAVANA.In regard to the report that the battle-ship Iowa is coming down to Havana, he laughingly said:      “I think I should have known something about it, and your report is the first I have heard of it.”      Capt. Sigsbee authorizes me to deny the report that he is breaking down, and the Montgomery's officers say that he, their guest now, is well.      The truth is that Capt. Sigsbee has been recovering for two weeks from the awful shock of the Maine disaster, getting better daily. 180 There was a time--about seven days after the catastrophe--when Capt. Sigsbee was dangerously near nervous prostration.      Some of his men were slowly dying in Havana hospitals. The flood of piteous pleas for information about lost relatives which Capt. Sigsbee received then and his courteous attempts to at least listen to the hourly questions of a horde of newgatherers, helped to exhaust him, and these things, combined with the incessant rattling of Havana's thousands of cabs over the stony streets about the hotel brought on insomnia.      At one time Gen. Lee really was alarmed for Capt. Sigsbee's reason.  But then the Captain moved on to a ship in the harbor and from that day Capt. Sigsbee has improved steadily.  With no one to disturb him he sleeps well.      A vigilant sentry at the Montgomery's gangway lessens the number of anxious correspondents who call on him.      He seems perfectly satisfied with the progress of the Court of Inquiry.      The Bishop of Havana, Santander y Frutos, true to his promise, will not allow the American Government to spend one cent in the leveling of the Maine sailors' graves or in admiring them, except by a monument, which he hopes will be erected.      Two Spanish visitors to the Montgomery on Saturday extended to the officers an invitation to a ball in the Casino, to be given by the Spanish marines.  The invitation was declined promptly.  The reason given was that they are still in mourning for the Maine's dead.      The insurgents fired a train at Jaruco, bound to Havana from Matanzas.  George Barnum, of Savannah, Ga., a passenger, was wounded slightly in an arm.  One other passenger was badly wounded.
