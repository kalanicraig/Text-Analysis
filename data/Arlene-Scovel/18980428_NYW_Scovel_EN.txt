WORLD'S COMMISSION LANDS IN CUBA.                             -----         By This Time It has Reached Gomez and Learned          His Plans for Co-operating with Our Troops.                             -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.) On board The World tug Triton, Off Matanzas, Cuba, April 26. (Via Key West, Fla., April 27.)           The World, Thursday, April 28, 1898, p. 3      The World's commission has started for Gomez.  It landed within forty miles of his usual camping grounds, forcibly persuading a Spanish fishing smack to quickly put them there.      The American people will, therefore, soon know whether the veteran Cuban commander needs the American infantry in doing ashore what our fleet does afloat, and if so, what number and how equipped.  Gen. Miles will know how many of our discarded but excellent Springfield rifles and how much ammunition the Cubans need to help themselves.  Armed, they will need but little other assistance.      With our field batteries and mountain guns, with a couple of troops of our cavalry and a couple of regiments of our infantry for taking towns and serving as stiffening examples, the thirty-odd thousand Cuban revolutionists can and are willing to themselves capture Spanish towns and bases, one after another.  With American artillery and plenty of ammunition, some food and pack animals with which to move both, Garcia could clean eastern Cuba of Spanish troops in three weeks.  American transports could take him what troops and supplies he needs in ten days' time.      There are a multitude of important points the United States Government might have settled with Gomez within one week from the historic morning of our fleet's departure from Key West.  Questions covering many or most of these have been taken in to Gomez by a World correspondent, F.H. Nichols, accompanied by Mr. Hare, Collier's Weekly photographer, and Mr. Whigham, the golf champion and correspondent of the Chicago Tribune.      The party is in charge of Major W.D. Smith, second in command of Gomez's body guard, who has been home on furlough.  He carries the Cuban Junta's official notification to its commander-in-chief of the action of Congress, the President, the American fleet and the surety 268 of Cuba Libre.      The warmth of the welcome The World party will have can be but slightly guessed.  Haggard, war-worn men suddenly informed that their three years of hopeless, heartless, up-hill struggle has succeeded; that their mirage, Cuba Libre, is a thing, a fact, backed by solid men of war, will be a scene of moving intensity.      What the Cuban revolutionists have endured will never be fully appreciated.  One couple of figures though tells it; Ò30,000 against 250,000Ó is the thing itself.  There have been many more Cuban rebels than that, but the number of useful guns has never exceeded the comparative nothing of 30,000.      From the answer the Cuban lieutenant in charge of a vidette gave me the other night on Cuba's coast.  ÒGive us rifles and cartridges; we don't want soldiers,Ó may perhaps be foreshadowed Gomez's ideas. 269 BRAVE WORLD CORRESPONDENT MAY BE KILLED OR CAPTURED. (Special Cable Despatch to The World.) On Board the United States Torpedo-Boat Porter, en route to Key West, April 27, via Key West.          The World, Thursday, April 28, 1898, p. 3      The World's daring Havana correspondent, Holmes, and his important information are missing.  He failed to appear at the meeting place the two appointed nights.  This light- draught flyer was sent to meet him by Admiral Sampson the night of April 23.      J. C. Fremont, the lieutenant commanding, ran toward the north shore cove carefully and signaled in the manner previously agreed. No answer.      For hours the Porter's officers watched.  The moon was not yet risen, coast and sky were of the same inky black. The loom of the shore a few hundred yards distant, although obscuring the coast line did not obstruct the view seaward. The Porter could be seen, and any moment the near-by Cojimar field artillery might begin puncturing the thin- skinned, valuable, almost defenseless torpedo-boat.      Holmes was to be waited for three hours.  The officers watched longer and then reluctantly gave up.      On the night of the 24th the hour set was Òsoon after dusk as possible.Ó      Again the swift Porter ran into the shaded bay.  The moon enabled them to find it easily.  This was the second trial.      The officers, to give Holmes every chance to reach them and the Admiral every chance to learn the facts about Havana's sealed interior, decided to go right to the beach.      Ensign Gillis took an eighteen-foot boat, four willing jackies swept the oars and the sandy beach was almost touched.      Gillis signaled.  No answer.      It is now known that this point was patrolled that night.      The signals of the previous evening had been seen, and Holmes either could not approach the beach or had attempted it and been captured.  Gillis held to the shore for an hour, then, after his return, the Porter's electric masthead light itself shot the white beams in proper intervals; but no Holmes. 270 Whether he is killed, captured or was accidentally prevented from furnishing World readers with most interesting news and his Government with much-needed information we will find out at once.  Courier Heilberg is ready for another dash.      The World will penetrate Havana, learn of its condition and print the news.
