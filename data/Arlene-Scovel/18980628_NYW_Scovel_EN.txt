OUR ARMIES WAITING FOR SUPPLIES TO COME UP.            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)            The World, Tuesday, June 28, 1898, p. 2      SIBONEY, Cuba.  (nine miles from Santiago).  June 24, via Playa del Este, June 27 (delayed in transmission).—At midnight (Friday) Gen. Chaffee’s brigade composed of the Seventh, Twelfth and Seventeenth Regiments of the United States regular army is in the extreme American advance.      It occupies a position at Hicaco, eight miles by road from the City of Santiago.      The army will pause in its forward movement to-morrow (Saturday) to await the bringing up of subsistence stores.      To-day’s advance has been extraordinary in view of the lack of transportation facilities.      Another brigade is marching back to a new base at Siboney for rations.  This will probably relieve Chaffee’s which would march back for the same reason to-morrow had not the brigade arrived from the distant base at Daiquiri behind Chaffee’s stupefied and exhausted bivouackers.      Spurs were worn to-day, by the First Volunteer Cavalry (Roosevelt’s Rough Riders) on a hardly gained hill.  The First regular cavalry are sleeping about the graves of their dead in the valley.  On the Spanish side all the fighting was done by the First Cabanas Regiment, the First Infantry of Guantanamo and the First Marine Batallion.  The battle of La Guasimas also was the first land battle in which the two armies have engaged. 323         LAST STAND OF THE SPANISH ON LA CRUZ HEIGHTS.                             -----        They Are Preparing to Make a Forlorn Hope Sally              with 3,000 Men, It Is Said Mounting                Cervera’s Guns on the Heights.                             -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)            The World, Tuesday, June 28, 1898, p. 2      OFF SANTIAGO, June 27, via Kingston, Jamaica.—When The World Despatch boat left the seat of war the situation had become most acute.  It was evident both the forces under Gen. Shafter and those of the enemy were about to [. . .] face to face for the grand and final struggle.      Gen. Shafter’s forces were busy all Sunday repairing the roads and hurrying the great siege guns to the front.      The pickets of the American forces have advanced to within three miles of the city of Santiago, and are occasionally exchanging shots with the outposts of the Spaniards.      Great stores of commissary supplies have been landed from the transport ships and army trains loaded with subsistence stores are pushing along toward the [. . .] of operation and are being concentrated around Sevilla.      The culmination of all those warlike preparations may be expected at any time within the coming week.  There will be a combined bombardment of the land and sea forces, and it is not difficult to foretell the results.      A report has come to Gen. Shafter from a spy, who left Santiago Sunday morning, that the Spaniards are preparing for a sally by 3,000 men—a sort of forlorn hope.      The system of harassing warfare continues. Bushwhacking parties take pot shots from time to time at our men who are at work on the corduroy roads, and the supply trains as they go forward are continually harassed.      The Harvard was expected at Guantanamo to-day with reinforcements which sailed from Newport News several days ago.      All accounts agree that an attack to-morrow may not be expected.  It will be toward the latter part of the week, in my opinion, and I base this upon good information.      The Osceola ran into The World’s despatch boat Three Friends off Guantanamo last week and smashed her hull badly.      Gen. Young knew the Spanish positions Friday, but his men advanced faster than the Cuban flanking parties, which 324 accounts for the ambush.  The Cubans advanced by difficult mountain paths.      The Cubans are now taking a position, 700 strong, in the extreme advance beyond Hicaco.      The fight of Friday covered the Spanish retreat.  The main body had four field pieces in the fight with the Cubans of the 23d.  These were unused yesterday.      The final stand of the Spanish in force will be made, it is expected, on La Cruz heights.  These are two miles southeast of the city of Santiago.  They have an elevation of 300 feet.      It is supposed that the Spanish are posting Cervera’s rapid-fire guns on these heights.      The army is resting and the men are in good spirits.
