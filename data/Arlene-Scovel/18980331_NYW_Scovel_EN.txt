LEE WON'T BELIEVE WASHINGTON NEWS WIRED TO HAVANA                             -----       Spanish Press Exults Over "Uncle Sam's Backdown,"                but the American Colony Refuses                   to Credit the Despatches.                             -----    OUR NAVAL OFFICERS THINK CABLE MUST HAVE BEEN TWISTED.                             -----    (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World.  Sent   from Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer.) On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Triton. The World, Thursday, March 31, 1898, p. 2                                     Havana Harbor, March 30.      Consul-General Lee refuses to believe the cabled despatches which report that time is to be given Spain to report on the Maine disaster.  He says:      “I refuse to believe anything they say until I receive further news, meaning official news from Washington.”      He knows that time is what Spain wants and what she has had for three murderous years—“murderous” is the only word to use.  Cuba's death-roll of innocents closely touches 700,000, not including the men, women and children who disobeyed Weyler, remained on the farms and died through sickness or massacre.  Only the obedient Cubans are counted.      Gen. Lee has seen all the despatches cabled yesterday and to-day.      He received in cipher a short synopsis of the report of the American Court of Inquiry and was rather surprised that those most conservative gentlemen went so far as to state explicitly that a mine caused the catastrophe.  This seemed to put upon Spain the responsibility of apprehending and delivering to justice the miscreants in their employ who touched the fatal button, for there was an electric connection, and The World hopes to produce soon conclusive evidence of that fact.                  HAVANA NEWSPAPERS REJOICE.      All the Havana dailies are jubilant, some guardedly, others openly, over the apparent American retreat and retraction before what they term "Spain's firm action, her power, the justice of her cause in Cuba and her strong support by Europe.”      The news received here yesterday and to-day actually 217 warrants the idea of an American backdown.  But the American colony refuses to believe the news received.  It thinks the cable depatches, even from the New York dailies to their correspondents, have been tampered with in the Palace.  From the highest American representative here to the brownest naturalized citizen all refuse to believe that the Maine massacre has been shelved, unexplained and unavenged.      Neither will they accept the cabled statement that Cuban affairs are to be allowed to drag under Spain's blighting hand until next October, when the new dry season will be on, and Spain can claim one more chance and the Cubans can continue to struggle and starve a year longer.                SPANISH DIVERS CONSUMING TIME.      As if in confirmation of the Spanish intention to delay their final report from day to day, the Spanish divers worked a few hours yesterday after a rest of one week.  They always go down in one spot.  They find nothing. Their work only serves as an excuse for time, time, and more time.      Yesterday's despatch said:      “The court was unable to form a concrete idea of the condition of the wreck from the divers' evidence.”      Navy men here who have seen and worked upon the figures, plans and statements submitted say the cable must have got twisted; that a commonsense human being, even though not a naval expert, could not see the drawings without forming a most complete “concrete idea” of the Maine's present shape, position and condition.      This misleading cable has been seized upon by the Havana press and the Government officials as disproving all the American claims.  The newspapers ask:      “If the court could not form an idea of the wreck, what was the use of their reporting anything?”  They do not seem to be far wrong.      The six insinuations printed in the Lucha yesterday are copied to-day in all the other papers except one.  As was cabled to The World, they are in substance that the Maine's men mutinied; that an officer of the Maine said he wished to see the whole American Navy destroyed; that all the officers except Jenkins and Merritt were dining aboard the steamer City of Washington on the night of the disaster; that the cannon were loaded and the torpedoes also; that no torpedo has been found, and that consequently they blew up the ship; and, finally, that the sailors were so scared and so poorly disciplined that they refused to lower the boats. 218 This stuff, which they know to be untrue, never would have been printed in the local papers had they not believed that the United States are afraid.      They teem with other reasons for what they term “Uncle Sam's backdown.”            EUROPE BELIEVED TO BE AT SPAIN'S BACK.      European hatred of the Monroe doctrine, which is an “obstacle to the colonial development of the Old World,” supported Spain, it is asserted, and frightened the United States.      The statements of the Havana press would be ridiculous were they not readily Spanish official utterances.  Every editorial printed in every Havana daily must first bear the stamp of the approval of the Captain-General and of Cuba. Spaniards here accept the press statement as being official and act accordingly.      Foreign Minister Hanatoux's speech in the French Chamber of Deputies, the attitude of the Emperors of Austria and of Germany, and the recent difference between the Russian Ambassador and the Queen Regent of Spain are said to have been so favorable to Spain as to prevent “Yankee aggression.”      Lieutenant-Commander Wainright denies positively the wild but persistent report that American divers have been arrested for trying to use dynamite on the Maine wreck in order to release the big guns.  I have been out to the Maine and find no diver missing.      It is a fact, however, that Spanish vigilance has been redoubled.  Two boats, each with a commissioned officer, constantly patrol close to the wreck, always keenly watching the divers.
