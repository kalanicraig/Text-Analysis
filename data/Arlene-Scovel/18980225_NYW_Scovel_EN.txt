It will not be sent to Washington before next Wednesday.      Investigating board examined to-day Rothchilds, of Detroit, who heard double Maine report from the City of Washington, and Wertheimer, of New York, about the sight and effect of the explosion they saw.      The investigating board have learned all they expect to know now, except the evidence that divers may find under the forward part of the wreck.  Divers in that vital region of the wreck’s mysteries did nothing to-day except that they found many more powder cases.  All showed seams split from pressure outside of them—seams collapsed in some.  I have seen them.  The copper was impressed by hexagonal forms.  Insides were intact, with powder unexploded.  They were not damaged.      Divers are still working in the after part of the Maine for bodies and cannon.  They have stopped working 97 forward.  They have accomplished their dangerous task, and the board of investigation is satisfied.      Strange to relate, many pieces of hexagonal powder, unexploded, have been found in the worst part of the wreck.      The board has most important testimony to-day and decided definitely that the Maine was sunk and destroyed through cause not accidental.      No more dead came out of the wreck to-day.  The wreck is lying still, with tell-tale front plates above water.  I send to-day photographs showing the carrion crows at work. The big powder cases, found intact to-day, give further proof that the forward main starboard magazine did not explode.      The Maine was clean on her bottom.  She left Norfolk dry dock Dec. 9.  Her McGinnis green antifouling paint on bottom plates is still fresh, as is seen in three pieces of iron protruding from forward of bow, as shown by The World’s great photograph, which is praised by everybody. To-morrow the board will probably go to Key West to take testimony there of officers and men sent over from the Maine to Admiral Sicard’s fleet after the explosion. This testimony can hardly change or add much to the evidence already got here.      Gen. Lee was in consultation with the members of the court to-day.      About thirty witnesses have been examined here.      The Right Arm has brought up already some important pieces of artillery.      The divers of the wrecking steamer Right Arm were examined by the court to-day.  Their testimony corroborates the evidence heretofore given by the Government divers.      The members of the court, accompanied by Consul- General Lee, were rowed around the Maine’s wreck to-day. They inspected the work of the divers. Only one diver is working now. He is from the Right Arm.      The work of recovering the contents of the ship progresses slowly.      Two full-dress coats and one dining-room chair were among the things brought up to-day.      Frederick G. Holzer, of New York, in San Ambrosio Hospital is thought to be dying.        LATER—RECEIVED BY THE WORLD AT 3 A.M. THURSDAY.      It was decided to-night to go to the Dry Tortugas, Key West, for a few days.  It leaves Saturday, but returns soon.  Orders just signed not allowing visitors on ship Mangrove, where the board meets. 98      Schooner Collins W. Walton off Double Head Short Key to-day caught carrier a pigeon of the United States Naval Practice Service, marked “U.S.N., 97.397.” The Bache sailed at 5 P.M. to-day for Dry Tortugas with survivors. Walter Loftus, Hefforn and Shea on board. Mack and Webber are still at hospital Alfonso XIII., and Cahill, Allen, Matterson and Holzer are at San Ambrosio. 99 NAVAL COURT OF INQUIRY FINISHES WORK IN HAVANA.                             -----        Goes Now to Key West, Having Taken Testimony of           All the Witnesses It Wishes to Examine at                 The Scene of the Catastrophe.                             -----         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)          The World, Friday, February 25, 1898, p. 1      HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 24—The United States Naval Court of Inquiry has finished its labors here.
