TO OFFSET MAINE'S LOSS, SPAIN WILL CLAIM MILLIONS.                             -----         Should President McKinley Demand $50,000,000       Indemnity, Premier Sagasta Will Ask $100,000,000,       It Is Thought, for Damages Through Filibustering.                             -----               SUCH COURSE TO BE TAKEN TO ENLIST                 EUROPE AND FORCE ARBITRATION.                             -----   If the Delay Sought For Is Obtained, America Will Have to        Feed Starving Cubans for a Year at Least, at an          Expense Far Greater Than the Maine's Cost.                             -----    (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World.  Sent   from Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer.)         On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Triton,           The World, Thursday, March 24, 1898, p. 3                                      Havana Harbor, March 24      It is most probable, indeed it is almost certain, that if the United States Government claims indemnity for the loss of the Maine, Spain will put in a counter-claim for hundreds of millions of dollars for damages through filibustering expeditions fitted out in America and permitted to sail from American ports.      In Madrid last June Colonial Secretary Moret told me frankly that only a desire to avoid plunging the country into war kept the Spanish Government from demanding these same damages.  He said:      ÒYour Government says it is trying to stop filibustering, yet it allows the Cuban Junta to solicit funds for arms and ammunition openly and to ship them to Cuba in steadily increasing quantities.  Your Government is responsible for the actions of its people--American money is carrying on the war against Spain, and the American Government is responsible for its continuance.Ó      Gen. Blanco said the same thing in his message to The World.      Sagacious old Gen. Gomez saw it long ago and foretold it as a sure cause finally of war when Sagasta found Cuba to be surely lost, and his Government was lost also if Cuba was lost to the Cubans and not to the United States.      Yesterday I saw one of the highest Spanish officials in Cuba.  He admitted to me that Spain's answer to an 205 American demand for Maine indemnity would surely be as indicated.      He reluctantly admitted that a blank refusal to pay for the battleship would not be backed by Europe, but he seemed assured of the fact that should Spain offer to pay promptly say fifty millions for the Maine if the United States would pay one hundred millions for Spanish loss through Cuban filibustering, Austria and France would at least endeavor to make the matter one of arbitration and thus to give to Spain the thing she has been clamoring for for the last three years, and the only thing she has gained--time, time, time.      Should Spanish indemnity for the Maine disaster become a question for an international board, and should its decision be the deciding point of American intervention, either America will have to feed Cuba at least a whole year more or the Cuban race will become practically extinct. For delay after delay will surely consume that much time.      If the Cubans are to live, the United States will have spent by that time as much for their food as the cost of the Maine.  If they are to die the quicker their misery is ended the better.      Although hundreds of tons of food have now been distributed to starving Cubans, and the good Bishop of Havana blesses America for its saving, Christian use, the Spanish Government in Cuba still denies that there is misery in Cuba.  The censor might as well deny that Spain has lost 150,000 brave soldiers in the Cuban rebellion.      At the World's request Mr. Klopsch, the directing member of President McKinley's Central Cuban Relief Committee, wrote a brief, business-like, unimpassioned cablegram, explaining what work was being done.      Naturally he mentioned hunger, for hunger is what Mr. Klopsch and his cornmeal and bacon are here for.  But the Government censor objected, and The World's readers did not get all that Mr. Klopsch wrote.  He said:      ÒAnd two hundred thousand hungry men, women and children will be sustained.Ó      The censor vigorously red-penciled the word Òhungry.Ó      Again Mr. Klopsch wrote:      ÒFour hundred and two towns and villages are hopelessly destitute.Ó      The censor cut out all but two words.  The sentence then was absolutely meaningless, but if the censor, by erasing words, meant to erase the fact, his action was as futile as it was foolish.
