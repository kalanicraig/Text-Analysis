His statements always have proved absolutely correct.  He has been the intermediary between the American Department and the high Spanish official quoted.  He cites the fact that the only known mine experiment was made by Gen. Weyler, who put some mines into Chorrera Bay and then took them out again on account of the danger to Spanish coasting vessels. 131      Chorrera is perhaps the best landing point for an invading force in the immediate vicinity of Havana.  It is sheltered and there is deep water close to the shore.      Those mines were not electrically connected; they were of the contact pattern. Similar and mammoth contrivances might easily have been dropped near a Government buoy such as the Maine was moored to. Any dark night would have covered the movements of a small party of engineers.      But Chorrera Bay is little used and the mines were removed.      Havana Harbor is much used.  It is not likely that mines ever were laid there.      The work could only have been done by the Government— and no one here for an instant imagines that the Government did it.      In view of the poor location for a mine, the new facts given and to-day’s credible report of a high official’s statement, the very strong probability now seems to be that no mine, surely no Government mine, blew up the Maine and martyred her crew.      The rope-towed torpedo statement of the same official is wonderfully borne out by The World’s exclusive detailed description in a previous dispatch of just the proper kind of rope in just the proper position discovered the night of the horror.  It disappeared the next morning.      Neither the official quoted nor the intermediary knew anything about the discovery of the rope.  The latter was astonished when informed of it.      Towing torpedoes against ships is an old, old method; one which any three or four, or possibly two, watermen could successfully employ.      The torpedo could be made of an old boiler flue, or a cast-iron box, or an oil drum, with just enough of wooden platform beneath it to float it a few feet below the surface.      Havana harbor was as placid as a mill pond that awful night.  The most crudely constructed torpedo would have served.  Its contents might have been any high explosive which, under the historic laxness of Spanish Customs officials, might have been smuggled, either by Cubans or by Spanish irreconcilables, from the United States into Havana as easily as tons of rebel munitions have been already.      Two of the numerous and tiny twelve-foot skiffs of the harbor could have been used, with two, or even one man in each.      The night was very dark.  Two boats together could                              132 have approached from Regia toward the port side of the Maine until near the range of vision—probably as close as three hundred yards.      Stopping there and dropping an anchor or a weight to hold the torpedo, one boat could have stayed there while the other towed the uncoiling rope.  It would take a thousand foot radius about the Maine’s stern.      She was moored only at the bow and a rope two and a half inches in circumference could easily have been thus passed under the Maine’s bottom.      When finally around her, the towing skiff could easily have pulled for the floating dock and Casa Blanca just where the rope was found.      The rope would straighten.  When the man in the skiff at the torpedo felt the strain strong he simply would cut the torpedo anchor rope and row to Regia for safety.      Meanwhile the towing skiff would approach the unguarded fishing boats of Casa Blanca, and the submerged torpedo would be drawn slowly toward the Maine’s port side.      The detonation could either be effected through the plunger in the torpedo if the construction was skillful or by a pull on a small line upon the trigger if the contrivance was simple. By the time the explosion came the men in the towing skiff would be safe at Casa Blanca and the men in the other boat would be safe in Regia.      But the rope would probably be cut, and never found except by dragging.      However, the men in the towing skiff might have been too much appalled by their work to cut the rope which was found on the floating dock anchor chains, showing just on the surface of the water.  The rope was found in exactly the proper position for the desired affair.      I think it all could have been done by ordinary watermen, and the whole theory seems much the most common- sense explanation which has yet appeared.      The first American tribute to the Maine’s dead has been arranged for to-morrow.  American tourists will initiate what should become a custom among all visiting Americans by going to the cemetery to honor the American martyrs.      S. Osterman, of New York; George C. Magee, of Chicago; A.J. Keaton, of Boston, and Dr. H. Tombocken, of Chicago, met yesterday to make arrangements.  The meeting was small but patriotic.      These visitors did what the American colony failed to do. 133      They wanted an American flag, but none was purchasable in Havana.  So they bought red, white and blue cloth, hired Cuban women to sew, Dr. Tombocken cut out the stars and a flag was ready.      Chaplain Chidwick will conduct a short service and the Bishop of Havana will grant a permit for a touching little memorial.      The American graves are yellow mud now; to-morrow an American wreath will at least be something to show the men buried there are not forgotten.      The American flag will remain in the cemetery, if permission can be obtained.  It will be used during the services, anyhow.  It was not in their gorgeous Spanish funeral, which now is termed a “triumphal procession” by many.      The Bishop will build a marble fence about the American graves, and says he hopes the United States will put up a splendid monument there.      The insurgent fight near Havana yesterday seems to have been specially arranged for Senator Proctor, who saw the results.  There was a sharp skirmish and fourteen Spanish are reported to have been killed.      Barton’s Bay Hospital was opened yesterday at No. 15 Tulipan street.      Further expert examination of the Maine’s bottom plates, which were blown clear out of the water, shows the sluice gates in one so they can be absolutely identified. These plates alone are considered sufficient proof that the Maine was blown up by design.      The Spanish divers who went down yesterday and remained a short time inspecting the Maine’s bottom declare that all the afterpart is intact.  Many plates on the starboard side are started, and the rivets so loose they can be easily removed by the hand.      These divers claim to have discovered sufficient evidence to prove that the explosion was from the inside, as the bulged-out condition of the plates would tend to prove.      However, they were not down long enough to carry out a thorough investigation.  They have been limited to work on the outside.      Capt. Sigsbee still maintains that they have no right to examine the inside of the wreck until his investigation is completed.  Then it is probable that, if the findings of the two commissions conflict as to the cause, the popular opinion here is that the case will be referred to a board of arbitration.  That this is anticipated is demonstrated 134 by an editorial in the leading pro-Spanish organ, the Correo, which hints for the first time at such a solution.      Meanwhile both sides will push work pending the reports of the two commissions.      The first steps taken yesterday by the Spanish authorities were conducted by divers belonging to the Obras del Puerto (harbor Commission) under the supervision of a civil engineer, Francis Coardois, who was in charge temporarily owing to the illness of Chief Engineer Pujals. Both are gentlemen of high standing, and the result of the work is impatiently awaited.      Two more divers will begin work to-morrow under the supervision of the naval authorities.  The Commission is presided over by Lieut. Pedro Peral, a brother of the celebrated inventor of the submarine boat bearing his name.
