           WORLD TUG TRITON FIRED ON BY CRUISERS.                             -----  Alert Watch Kept by Our Blockaders That Does Ill for Hungry        Havana—A Spanish Officer Captured and Paroled.                             -----            (Special Cable Dispatch to The World.)                     April 27, 1898, p. 3      KEY WEST, April 26.—The watch kept by the American blockading fleet is intensely alert.  Triton, The World’s tug, would be a very small blockade runner, yet while steaming rapidly the length of the Cuban blockade she was flooded with light and brought up with a round turn by at least two ships on every station.  They seemed to turn up from every point of the compass.      No sooner had the Triton’s course been quickly changed, so as to approach the big investigating eye and an authoritative “What ship is that?” had been meekly answered by “Triton sir,” than we ran into another actively inquiring mass of brain-directed steel.      One time the Triton had shells fired at her before she could round to.  The ship was the armed yacht Hornet.      The Terror was also wide awake and fired four shots. The Triton just escaped the last projectile.  Capt. Sudlow had never seen The World’s despatch boat and sent a boarding officer, who finding her papers correct, departed.      Major Smith’s small arsenal was in plain view and the Triton’s navy rifles were in evidence.  The ensign remarked: “Hump, this is the darndest newspaper boat I every saw,” and went over the Triton’s side into his gig.      The Admiral has instructed Lieut. Staunton to arrange signals for newspaper boats, that no more coal nor ammunition be wasted chasing them.      There is no danger that Havana will be fed for long or often.  The Terror captured a good-sized Spanish coasting steamer this morning about 1 o’clock.  She was heavily loaded with sugar and general merchandise and was anchored near the shore for the night.  To-day she started for Key West.      A big sugar-laden schooner has also been captured.  A prize crew is sailing her north.      Matanzas is sealed as tightly as Havana.  Many large Spanish sailing vessels are there, loaded with sugar. Sagua La Grande also has Spanish schooners, but the water is too shallow to risk going in for them.      Cardenas has a most complicated ship channel, which at 266 night is almost impassable.  Mariel has a winding ship channel, and Bahia Honda, the extreme western port to be sealed, has no railroad connection with Havana.  Even should American land forces not occupy and intercept provisions landed here, the Cubans will.      The first real prisoner of this war is Second Lieut. Juan Pino Fernandez.  He commanded the sentinel fort at the mouth of the River Canasi, on the northeast coast, and its twenty men.  His wife in Matanzas, thirty miles away, bore him a son.  The lieutenant embarked in a fishing schooner to visit his wife and was captured in the act.  The Hornet brought him and his servant aboard the flagship.      Capt. Chidwick discovered the mission of Pino, and asked him to breakfast.  The lieutenant said he had no appetite.  Capt. Chidwick consulted with the Admiral and smilingly told the captive he was a free man.  The Spaniards took his release as philosophically as he had born his capture and bowed courteously.  By parole, written by Capt. Chidwick, translated to him by the World correspondent, and signed by Lieut. Fernandez, he promised not to bear arms against the United States during the present war unless regularly exchanged.  Lieut. Pino was then shown over the ship.      Capt. Wallack’s marines opened his eyes in admiration. They were doing bayonet drill, and did it well.      “How great the men are!” he said on noting the tall sailors on the right of a drill squad.      “Are there more of these?” he asked, when I explained as well as I could the eight-inch guns.      Some one said to him: “You will have to go to Spain for the rest of the war.”      His face lit up. “Ah, the happiness of it!” said he. “Here it is marching and sweating and suffering, and to no use; the enemy won’t fight.”      Capt. Chidwick sent him ashore at Cojimara under a flag of truce.  He is probably now telling Blanco that all Americans are not pigs, and that some American ships are not made of pasteboard.
