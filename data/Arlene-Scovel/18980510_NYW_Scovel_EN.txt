GEN. GOMEZ'S LETTERS BROUGHT BY WORLD MAN.                             -----        Willing to Co-Operate with an American Landing              Force--Replies to Admiral Sampson's                          Questions.            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)            The World, Tuesday, May 10, 1898, p. 1      KEY WEST, May 9.--In one of the letters brought back from Gomez's camp by The World commissioner, the insurgent Commander-in-Chief expresses his gratitude to the American people for their sympathy and proffered aid.  Under date of Barracones, Santa Clara Province, April 29, he writes:      “You understand with what tenacity the Cuban people have fought, and, knowing their heroism, you have been able to comprehend that those who, with exemplary self- abnegation have defended their rights, cannot forget their duty to appreciate as brothers the sons of the Union who from the beginning of this struggle have been upon our side.  The love and the thankfulness of peoples cannot be translated into words; but, expressing my sentiments, which are those of the Cuban people, receive my embrace, the warm salute which those who have known how to break their chains send to the worthy citizens of the great North American Republic. “M. GOMEZ.” To Gen. Miles Gen. Gomez writes expressing his desire to co-operate with him.      To Admiral Sampson, by special courier, he gives definite replies to questions carried to him by The World correspondent--how many men he can concentrate at different points of Cuba in different lengths of time, how many rifles Cubans want and what kind, what class of artillery and how many guns, what class, kind and quantity of food, medicine, clothing and equipment the Cubans can best use-- all the questions carried to Gomez by The World correspondent for Admiral Sampson.  The courier's name is Jorer.  He was United States Vice-Consul at Sagua under W. B. Barker.  When the Americans left, Jorer went into the woods and Gomez seized this opportunity of sending Jorer home to testify to the United States Government the condition of the Cubans, civil and military, and to more 287 fully conform to military etiquette than would have been the sending of state despatches by a newspaper correspondent, as was first contemplated.      Gomez is rather nettled that a military attache? should be sent to Garcia before he himself was notified that the United States expected his co-operation.      The Cubans can use now about thirty thousand rifles with ammunition for them, mules to transport it, and some packers to run the pack trains.  The desired food weights about half that of American soldiers' rations.  It consists of beef, bacon, rice, cornmeal, sugar and salt.  The medicines asked for are chloroform, for gunshot wounds, and quinine, for malarial fever.  There is no small-pox or yellow jack in the fields of Cuba, and remedies for such are unasked for.  Clothing, if sent, should be two washable suits of three pieces each--shirt, trousers and coat, with several belt pockets.  The Cuban leaders don't wish uniform hats to be sent, probably fearing that Cuban privates might too closely resemble Spanish soldiers.  Pack saddles should be of the “saw-buck” pattern.  No horses are needed, nor cavalry animals of any kind.      Gomez's letter to Admiral Sampson also treats of landing places.      The World correspondent brought Coast Pilot Broche to the fleet.  He belongs to Carillo's forces, and is put at Sampson's disposal by Gomez.  He will conduct the first American expedition to Cuba.      Gomez's letters to Miles and Sampson express his warm desire to aid in any manner and at once.      To President McKinley he expresses for Cuba the official thanks of the new republic.
