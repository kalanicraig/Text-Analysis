BUGLER PLAYING “TAPS” OVER HIS                  DEAD COMRADES SOBBED ALOUD.                             -----          (Special Cable from a Staff Correspondent.) The World, Wednesday, June 29, 1898, p. 2      GUASIMAS, Cuba, June 24. via Playa del Este (delayed in transmission).—The First and Tenth Cavalry buried their dead at twilight this evening where Spanish bullets swept overhead most furiously.      The burial place was in a small clearing in the dense undergrowth.  A thousand bared heads bowed as Gen. Young and a staff cavalryman read the service.      When the words “And now we commit them to earth” were spoken there was impressive silence.      The men as they stood under the trees in the growing darkness sobbed when the band played the dead march after the reading of the Scriptures, and the bugler playing the beautiful “taps” at the close of the service was overcome by his emotions and fairly cried.      There was no volley fired over the trench where seven men lay, completely blanketed, a row of silent exclamation points of the war.  It was feared that the shots might attract the enemy.  Five of the men buried came from Troop K, First Cavalry.      While the services were being read the Second Massachusetts and Fourth United States Infantry were vigorously marching to the front past the sad, motionless body of mourners.      It was the epitome of life and death.      First there was the dead march and the chudding of shovels—and then a lively two step took the soldiers’ minds from the dead comrades to the living Spaniards ahead.
