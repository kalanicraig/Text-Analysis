   NOTHING BUT A MINE COULD HAVE BLOWN UP THE BATTLE-SHIP. ----- Spanish Naval Officer May Have Mistaken the Exploding for the Testing Key ofthe Submarine Battery.-----MAINE WAS ONLY ONCE BEFORE IN THE SAME POSITION, BUT THEN IN MOONLIGHT.-----(Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World.)        The World, Sunday, February 20, 1898, pp. 1, 2      HAVANA, via Key West, Fla., Feb. 19.--Every indication so far as cabled shows that nothing could have destroyed the Maine so peculiarly but a submerged mine of large size.      If so, the Spanish naval officer in charge may have mistaken the testing key for the exploding key or a fanatic might have touched it, or an intoxicated and reckless attache of the Navy Department.      As shown conclusively by the position of the ship, the point of greatest destruction, and the many other facts already cabled, all pointing in the same direction, it seems that the laws of nature must have changed if the forward magazine did not explode.  It is definitely known that no other magazine did.      If the divers find out that the forward turret has its top still on, then the awful fact may be accepted that the Maine was blown up by the Spanish Government's submarine mine.      No movable torpedo could have done the damage.      These are the opinions of naval experts and experts in explosives in Havana.      Now that the governmentally imposed decorum is over some rabid Spanish newspapers here are guardedly showing joy over the disaster.      The Correo intimates that Capt. Sigsbee was not in his ship because he had a uniform on at the funeral. Capt. Cowles, of the Fern, wore a uniform then, and hence the mistake. The newspapers made the most of this incident.      A Matanzas paper rejoices almost openly and the Spanish merchants of Sagua La Grande drank cases of champagne behind closed doors the day after.      On Havana's streets the Spanish shopkeepers' faces are on the sly grin constantly.  The difference from their usual aspect is remarkable and is noted by everybody.  This 61 is common talk.      It is now known that the Maine had only swung into the position she occupied at the time of the explosion but once before.  Then it was on a bright night.  Tuesday night, when the explosion occurred, was dark. Each succeeding fact is more and more sombre. So far there is not a fragment of proof to indicate that the original explosion was internal or that there was a later explosion of anything in the Maine. Several insulting circulars have been gotten out. One, published just before the explosion, stated clearly that the Maine should be destroyed. Another, of yesterday, supposedly against autonomy, glories in the sinking of the Maine.      Pen and ink sketches of Pelayo sinking the whole American fleet multiply all over town.  The little light- house tenders and the Fern are really thought by the lower classes to be the real kind of vessels the United States Navy has.      Politeness to Americans on the pavements and in the theatres is much decreased.      The situation is really grave.  The wives of some American hospital service surgeons and correspondents are leaving on this ship for Key West.      An anti-American outburst might happen at any time.      I was stopped to-day by the Spanish patrol-boat from getting nearer the Maine than 300 feet.  American officers were on board, and the American flag was flying from the rear and only mast.      I requested a permit from the commandant of the Spanish warship Alfonso XII. as a matter of courtesy.      It was refused, and I went within five yards of the Maine, claiming my right as an American citizen to go as close to a piece of United States soil as desired.  Force was not used and I remained.      If the boatman is fined I shall protest through the Consul. 62      HAVANA DROPS GRIEF AND TURNS TO GAYETY OF CARNIVAL. -----  (Special Cable Despatch from a World Staff Correspondent.)            The World, Sunday, February 20, 1898, 2      HAVANA, Cuba, Saturday, Feb. 19—8.30 P.M.--The first awful shock of the Maine's annihilation is over, and men's minds are cleared.      The first impressions, the first great spasms of sympathy are over.  To-morrow the carnival will begin on the broad Prado.  The streets will teem with gaudy costumes, masked women and richly horsed carriages, filled with butterfly children.  Confetti will fly from joyous hands to the roysterers' faces.      All the while broad death barges will be slowly moving along Havana's water front filled with shapeless, awfully mangled forms of what four short days ago were sturdy American sailors.      At night sensuous Cuban music will measure dancing feet on land while the Maine's remaining battle-mast will stand a silent sentinel over mangled American life and iron.            DIVERS GETTING READY FOR PERILOUS WORK.      Under Havana Bay to-day divers are preparing for energetic work. To-morrow most of the bodies still in the wreck will be under ground and the private papers and secret state documents will be safe aboard the Fern.      The next day the investigation will begin in earnest.      According to present advices Spanish divers will accompany the two New York's men and the surviving Maine diver in this most delicate and dangerous work.      The battle-ship is a mine.  She was compartmented into a veritable honeycomb.  Her massive steel cross walls and divisions have been wrenched, split and torn.      The inside is a labyrinth of sharp turns and saw edges and is darker than her exploding night.      The only other night the wind blew from the northwest it was clear and light and nothing happened.                    HORRIBLE THINGS INSIDE.      The divers' work forward, where the ship was literally chewed up, will be difficult and hazardous.  In the berth deck they will collide with nameless human things each step.  There is where the sailors slept and smothered in rushing water.      The Madrid and Havana newspapers enthusiastically approve the Government's action in preventing The World's 63 four divers from working under the direct charge of Chief Engineer Howell, as directed by Capt. Sigsbee.  The bodies were intact then.  Their families in many cases could have had them.      But extremest courtesy kept Mr. Howell from disregarding the Spanish guard-boat coxswain's order.  No American diver can go into the wreck unless accompanied by Spanish divers.      All day long The World men waited while red tape was slowly unwinding.  The divers were not to investigate--in fact, their simple helmets stopped their usefulness before the telltale bottom could be reached—but they were fully able to secure the bodies and that was all I asked them to do.      It was evening before the formalities had exhausted themselves.      The naval divers came early this morning--just too late to be of any humane use.                 BODIES NO LONG RECOGNIZABLE.      If the Spanish censor allows me to say so, the bodies now are so decomposed that they are lifted from the water into coffins on barges without the religious service they might have had yesterday, and are taken by sea to the coast a mile distant from the cemetery, then conveyed by wagon to trenches.  All this might have been helped.      The Coast Survey steamer A. D. Bache, under Yacht Commander Barnett, brought Ensign Brumby, who will be in charge of the divers.  There are two outfits and four sailors will work the air pumps for three divers.      The Maine diver is willing to go down into the horrors of the hulk.  He will be invaluable, as he knows the ship. A man to recover instantly from the awful shock and then face the results must be of steel.                     SPANISH SAILORS' SYMPATHY.      The Liberal, of Madrid, says the American jingoes claim the Spanish sailors don't really sympathize.  If the jingoes could have seen the Alfonso XIII.'s jackies pulling the boats about under the dropping shell fragments to rescue American life they would see their mistake and be sorry for it.      Capt. Sigsbee and the investigation board are going ahead.  Within two days they should know whether or not, the forward magazine exploded.  That will tell the tale of accident or design.      The Maine's diver was sleeping in the after turret, and went up through its top manhole miraculously.  The funnel was falling which now closes it over the explosion. 64 None of the seven foreign Consuls, all Spaniards called upon American Consul Barker or expressed regrets in any manner.  The rest of the island, as far as is known, was friendly, at least in official interchange of courtesies.      Urgate, the brave Havana volunteer fireman who arrived at the water front immediately after the explosion, is said to have been publicly thanked by Gen. Lee.  He will be decorated by the Spanish Government.                  DESERVE THANKS OF CONGRESS.      Some Spanish sailors deserve the thanks of Congress. They remain in great danger long after Capt. Sigsbee called the boats off, and saved several lives.      Gen. Lee has finished officially thanking the city corporation for the burial of the dead, and has concluded with Capt. Sigsbee the formal visiting.      Washington has also exchanged courtesies with Madrid, and the ceremonies are over.      But for the brave Spaniards, native Cubans and Americans who risked life to save white and black alike something handsome should be done.      If they are treated as well as the American tars here and at Key West are caring for Capt. Sigsbee's pug Peggy or the marine cat Old Tom they will be richly rewarded.  The softest bed on the Fern is given up to the rescued cat. The brave marine orderly Anthony, assisted by the whole fo'castle, is in attendance.  Anthony says:                           TOM AND PEGGY.      "Tom has always been a marine cat.  He joined us thirteen years ago.  He was born on the old Brooklyn Navy Yard monitor and came to us from the marine corps of the Minnesota.      "Tom is a big tiger cat.  One foot is slightly burned and he is yet scared.  He won't move from his bunk, but the men say he will recover.”      The Maine's goat was so fortunate as to be taken seasick and left at Key West, where he now is a hero by the reflected glory of Sigsbee's Peggy.      Apart from the awful massiveness and significance and possibilities of the Maine horror are little things which make one's throat tighten.                        FOUND HIMSELF BLIND.      A strapping fellow with bandaged eyes kept asking for "my chum Bill—he pulled with me in the Captain's gig."      He asked those around him to raise the bandage so that he might look for "Bill."  But he did not see him.  He was blind.      When he realized it he quietly lay back on his pillow                              65 without a whimper.      The body of Lieut. Jenkins, who blindly went to duty and met the water, has not yet been secured.      So far 139 bodies have been recovered.  Of these thirty-six have been identified.  The others will occupy nameless graves.      Those identified to-day were Harris and Lund, out of nine.  The World has printed all the other names.      A Havana paper asserts that 55 or 56 of the Maine's crew were Spaniards.  As was cabled to The World, there were two sailors who were born on Majorca Island, which is Spanish territory.  One of them was killed and the other was severely injured.                        NURSES' NOBLE WORK.      Sister Mary Wilbur, or England, is doing noble work at San Ambrosio Hospital for the injured, whose agonies are now at their height.  The burned skin and flesh are being cut away.      Some Cuban women have been there, too.      Miss Barton took two days away from her starving reconcentrados, and the United States Marine Hospital surgeons and the local American physician, Dr. Findlay, are aiding the Maine surgeon, Dr. Henneberger, in looking well after the sufferers.      A fine, well-ventilated house in the healthy suburb of Buenos Ayres is ready for the men, but Gen. Lee thinks it not worth while to move them, because as soon as one gets strong enough he will be moved to Key West.  They should be moved right now out of San Ambrosio, as many never will recover to reach Key West. A STRANGE COINCIDENCE.A remarkable thing is that the Mangrove, under Capt. Musgrave, came to assist the Maine. Just twenty years ago the same Captain steamed from Key West on about the same kind of orders to the relief of Sigsbee on the Cuban coast, about thirty miles west of here. Sigsbee had the Coast Survey steamer A. D. Bache. She is in the harbor now, but then she was on the rocks.      Sigsbee had taken a Spanish pilot for the first time in months, and got run ashore.  His ingenious and nervy saving of the vessel brought him the thanks of the Navy Department.  Old sailors here remember it. 66                AMERICANS ARE STARVING IN CUBA. ----- Pitiful Appeal to The World from Citizens Living in Trinidad.-----CONSULAR RELIEF FAILS THEM. -----Sympathetic Agent Already in Debt from Helping the Most Destitute.-----IS M’GARR DOING HIS DUTY? -----Complaints Against Our Consul in Cienfuegos Sent to Be Made Public by The World.-----              (From a World Staff Correspondent.)              The World, February 20, 1898, p. 24      HAVANA, Feb. 9.—One United States Consul in Cuba, Owen McGarr, stationed at Cienfuegos, reports to the State Department that there is little or no destitution in his district.  On the contrary, there is much.  Even American citizens there are starving, as is shown by the following, sent to me to be forwarded to The World.                               “Trinidad, Cuba, Dec. 3, 1897. “To the Editor of The World:“Having appealed twice to the Consulate of the United States at Cienfuegos and once to the Consulate-General at Havana while Mr. Lee was in the States and being in a state bordering on starvation, I, in the name of the destitute American citizens reconcentrados at Trinidad de Cuba, have decided to make our last appeal to the New York World, and we are sure, or at least have great hopes, that in this way the relief out of the funds appropriated by Congress for this purpose, and which is all that we count upon for the maintenance of ourselves and families, will be again given to us.      “We understand that Mr. Carlos Yznaga, the consular agent at this city, has instructions from the Consulate at Cienfuegos not to distribute rations unless he has funds on hand, and as he very seldom has any funds, according to the instructions received by him, he has to stop the distribution of rations and we are left for weeks at a time 67 without any food for our families.      “Now, for instance, the consular agent knowing our great need of relief, continued distributing rations, although he had no funds on hand, still he incurred a debt of $100, and he has been ordered to stop the distribution until he pays this debt, which at the rate that he receives remittances of funds ($50 every two or three weeks) will keep us without any relief for from four to six weeks.      “Once before we have been three weeks without relief, since Mr. Yznaga took charge of this consular agency, on Aug. 18 last, and since the relief was first distributed in Cuba to Aug. 18, we have only received three weeks’ rations.      “Why is it that the destitute American citizens at Trinidad, who are just as much in need of help as their countrymen in other cities, are kept for weeks at a time without help—a thing which does not happen anywhere else? Is this right?  And if not, then whose fault is it?      “We very often hear that The World says that the citizens of the United States who have been reconcentrados by Weyler’s order were not in need, as they had rations, but you see that at least in Trinidad this is not the case, and we are very often on the same level as the Spanish reconcentrados, having to beg in the streets in order that our poor children may stop crying from hunger.      “If this state of affairs continues much longer the photographer of The World will find a better field for his camera among American reconcentrados at Trinidad than where he is now photographing the Spanish reconcentrados.  We will be thankful to the end of our lives to The World if through its columns we will have in future, till the funds appropriated by Congress are exhausted, the certainty of receiving food for our families once every week.      “In the name of the destitute American citizens in Trinidad, Cuba, I am respectfully yours.                   “MANUEL RUIZ DE PORRAS.”      Here is another letter sent to me for transmission to The World which indicates that Consul McGarr is not thorough, to say the least, in the performance of his duties:                               “Trinidad, Cuba, Dec. 3, 1897. “To the Editor of the World:      “I read The World at the consular agency, and I often see that you give space in your columns to letters from the people.  Will you admit this one?      “My house was seized by the police at this city for the use of the commandante militiar and they agreed to pay 68 $17 a month rent, but after taking possession of the house they informed me that I had better whistle for my rent.  As they have been in the house more than three months and always refused to pay, I laid the case before the Consular Agent at this city, and he referred me to the Consul at Cienfuegos.      “The Consul, Mr. McGarr, answers that, although I am an American citizen, absolutely nothing can be done in my behalf.  If this is so, what is the use of article 7 of the treaty between the United States and Spain, which reads: ‘And it is agreed that the subjects or citizens of each of the contracting parties, their vessels or effects shall not be liable to any embargo or detention on the part of the other for any military expedition or other public or private purpose whatever?’                      “MARINO MEDINILLA.”      The genuineness of these pitiful documents and the truth of what they set forth are guaranteed by the Consular Agent at Trinidad, Carlos Yznaga y Yznaga, of the New York family of that name.  They are only two out of many complaints I have received.      O. B. Stillman, one of the largest American sugar planters of Cuba, tersely illustrated the condition of one of Consul McGarr’s towns by saying: “Cats are 40 cents apiece in Trinidad.”  Mr. Stillman’s plantation is near there.      There is starvation, too, in Cienfuegos, Consul McGarr’s official residence.  He is extremely popular with the Spanish business men.  They gave him a banquet recently on his return to his post.  In the month of December I saw fully twenty starving beggars in five blocks of one street there.      Although there is no provision to that effect in the consular regulations issued to Cuban consulates, Mr. McGarr demands for himself a proportion of the fees collected by each of the consular agents in his jurisdiction.  Up to $1,000 such fees should go to the local agent.  Yet McGarr claimed and received (in stamps) one-half of the total annual fees of Consular Agent Madrigal at Sancti Spiritus. The fees amounted to about $7.  And McGarr got about one- half.      He also requested Mr. Yznaga to forward to Cienfuegos one-third of the Trinidad agency fees.      Mr. McGarr is not at all satisfactory to his American citizen charges nor to his agents.  The Cienfuegos Consulate of the United States is about the poorest I have ever seen of its kind.
