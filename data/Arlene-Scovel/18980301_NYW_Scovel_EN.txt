ONLY ONE HERO'S BODY BROUGHT UP YESTERDAY. -----The World's Divers Could Have Saved Them All in Two Days--Two of the Maine's Wounded, Leaving Hospital, Attracted Great Crowds in Havana.         (By Cable from a World Staff Correspondent.)            The World, Tuesday, March 1, 1898, p. 2      HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 28.ÑOnly one body was recovered to- day from the Maine's wreck by the divers.  And it was mutilated.      The World's divers could have saved all the bodies in two days if the tender of them had been accepted.      Everybody censures the United States Government for its delay in performing its sacred duty to its dead sailors.      Great crowds collected this evening along Carlos III. drive.      At first it was believed that they were attracted to see Acting Capt.-Gen. Gonzalez Parrado, who was out driving. But the sightseers were not watching for the Spanish Deputy Commander-in-Chief. They were attracted by the forms of two men descending from the Alfonso XIII. Hospital, all bandaged and dressed in bright blue uniforms.      These men were Martin V. Webber, landsman, and Thomas Mack, seaman, two of the Maine's heroes who have recovered already and were on their way to the United States Coast Survey steamer Bache to return home.      The following incident indicates the bravery and the sufferings of those who escaped with their lives:      In the first moments after the explosion of the Maine Chief of Police Paglieri went to the burning steamer. Noting the sailors fighting for their lives, silently Chief Pagileri remarked:      "They cannot have suffered much because they don't give vent to lamentations."      Many such are buried in their graves.      Miss Clara Barton is very active in the work of relief of Cubans.      Near her residence here she has established within two days a hospital for baby reconcentrados in a handsome chalet of Tutipan Cerro.      To-day she sent supplies to eighteen towns--in all 116 twenty-five districts.      The receipts of food for the distressed in Cuba are increasing.  They should continue.
