MINE CABLE MISSING FROM SPAIN’S ARSENAL                       IN HAVANA HARBOR.                             -----  It was There in Large Quantities Until About a Month Before        the Arrival of the Maine; Then It Disappeared.                             -----               BUOY TO WHICH THE BATTLE-SHIP WAS              MOORED HAD BEEN SHUNNED FOR MONTHS.                             -----    Fact That “Buoy No. 4” Appears on the Harbor Charts In  Another Location Not Explained By the Spanish Authorities.                             -----  (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World, Sent from     Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer.)        (On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Triton)           The World, Wednesday, April 6, 1898, p. 2                                      Havana Harbor, April 5.           Careful investigation proves that buoy No. 4 was not used during two months prior to the Maine’s arrival in Havana Harbor.      The Assistant Superintendent of Havana’s Harbor Commission went to the arsenal for mine detonating cable about a month before the Maine’s arrival.      Before the arrival here of the mammoth floating dock the Harbor Commission was dredging a place for emplacement and operation.      The last two weeks' work was day and night. Electric light was needed, and the assistant superintendent in charge of the dredgers asked the local electric light plant managers for the cost of furnishing it.      The answer showed very great expense for the long submarine cable necessary.  The superintendent well knew the Spanish arsenal, its contents and their uses.  He said: “Would a mine cable do?”  He was answered “Yes.”  Then he said there was plenty of it in the arsenal.      Next day he told the electric light people that all such submarine cable had been used up.  So a small electric plant was put upon the dredge itself, and night work went on without shore connections.      Had there been any submarine cable in the arsenal it is very certain that it would have been forthcoming for its loan only was asked.  It was Government work and time was precious. 232 Where was this cable used?      Buoy No. 4, when the Maine was moored to it, had been shunned for months.  Capt. Rouse’s letter noting the fact printed in The World was true.  It has been later corroborated by the printed testimony before the board.      I have seen almost every American captain entering the harbor since the Maine disaster.  All say the same.      I do not use their names, because if Spain continues here and the captains resume regular traffic things would be made very hot for them.  Spanish pilots refuse absolutely to speak of the affair.  They will not even explain why the Maine’s pilot gave the navigating officer one number as proper while the plotting of the harbor charts showed its location to be much nearer another section.      The board reports the Maine’s annihilation from a submarine mine—which would absolutely have to be a Government mine—perhaps accidentally detonated, perhaps not.      The World can produce sworn testimony to the two facts here stated.      In regard to the use of the mine cable Spain must answer the question, “What did you do with it?  And Spain must say why no other ships had been anchored to what their pilot called buoy No. 4, or, there can be but one answer to “Who blew up the Maine?”
