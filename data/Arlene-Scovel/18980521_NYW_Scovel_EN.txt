TWO COURIERS SENT TO THE INSURGENTS.                             -----         Exciting Attempt of the Tecumseh to Land the                Messengers on a Guarded Portion                    of the Island’s Coast.                             -----          SMALL BOAT FIRED UPON BY AN ALERT SENTINEL.                             -----       A Second Landing Made Without Incident—Great News             Taken to the Cubans by the Messengers                     of the United States.                             -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)            The World, Saturday, May 21, 1898, p. 2      KEY WEST, Fla., May 20.—The smart little steamer Tecumseh has conducted two landings upon the Cuban coast, thirty-five miles apart, and both within six hours.      Cuban surf, clear daylight and Spanish sentinels made the undertaking difficult.  For fifty miles east of Havana every sheltered cove, every projecting point and almost every unfrequented strip of practicable sand beach has its guard detail of Spanish cavalry.  These are in constant touch with the massed Spanish infantry and artillery occupying the crest of the low coast ridge.  The large units of the enemy are there posted from half a mile to a mile and a half from the beach.  They are in readiness to be thrown against the daily expected disembarkation of American troops in force, and they keep a sharp lookout.      Yesterday afternoon the Tecumseh sheered away from Cuba.  Gen. Nunez was on board in charge of four Cuban couriers.  One pair was Col. Baldomero Acosta and Estaban Delgado: the other Major Alfredo Sims and Olympia Trivices.      Acosta is a brave man.  He has been repeatedly wounded.  He kept Havana’s western suburb in excitement for two years, until his uncured injuries all but paralyzed his body.  Now he is in eager, active service of the United States forces.      Sima arrived in Key West only a week ago.  With his companion he had captured a Spanish fishing boat and sailed to the blockading squadron.      It was decided that one pair of couriers was to be landed at one point, and if resisted there the other couple was to be put ashore at a new place.  Somehow or other communication was to be established with certain insurgent forces, and that has been done. 301      Cuban Coast Pilot Blanco saw the black coast line shortly before daylight this morning.  Lieut. G. R. Evans, commanding the renamed tug Edward Luckenbach, of New York, quietly called the engine-room through the speaking tube. Gongs would have made too much noise, he said.      “Turn her over as slow as you can,”      There are unknown, uncharted and steadily-building coral reefs along Cuba’s north coast.      Barefooted sailors tried each shutter and window and door to see that each was tightly shut or had its smoke- colored canvas shade firmly drawn.  One little beam from the binnacle occasionally threw into relief the strong lines of the helmsman’s face as he peered at the compass figures.  Evans blinded this light streak as well, and the Tecumseh rippled toward shore with her lights most completely “doused.”      Old Blanco screwed his eyes into the night glasses. He looked for the blackening strip of shore to stand out into trees.  He found his landmark.      We had a league of coast to pass.  Arriving at the proper point midway between two Spanish outposts the tug slowly closed in and the sounding line kept softly splashing.  “By the mark, ten, sir.” was whispered up to the dark pilot.      The wherry had been lowered further out and hung almost touching the phosphorescent rolls of water from the vessel’s bow.  Half a gale of wind was paralleling the coast from the eastward.  Right under the land a long swell was breaking in spurts of white water against the coral beach of the shore.      Four sturdy young fellows of the ship’s crew took their seats upon the thwarts.  Acosta, Delgado and the Cuban pilot crouched in the boat’s bottom.  The falls were softly let go.  I took the steering oar and we pulled toward the surf.      At the edge of the breakers the light boat was swung about, bow on to the seas.  As each white racer came curling on it was “Give way together!”  In the hollows between them it was “Hard astern!”      Steadily in we backed until the gray light showed the shore to be a six-foot vertical wall of coral.  The breakers hit it like trip-hammers and the white foam flew.      We got out of that and found a gentler beach a quarter mile further on.  In again through the breakers we backed. As a nine-foot roller fell, the Wheery’s stern pounded the coral.  We could approach no closer.  Acosta sprang out, rifle in hand, and stumbled and was rolled by the water 302 ashore.  We saw him clamber the solid bank and disappear in the bushes.  Almost instantly he emerged hastily and plunged into the sea again.  We waited and hauled him dripping aboard.      “Vamos habra faego pronto,” he said (“Let’s get out of this; there will be shooting soon.”)      And there was.  Hardly had the boat’s crew bent their ashes when the peculiar flat smack of a Mauser rifle discharge sounded.  The sentinel on the point had seen us. He only shot once and hastened into the bushes, probably to notify his outpost of the fact of a Yankee landing.      We reached the Tecumseh: the wherry was hauled up hand over hand and the Tecumseh steamed out at full speed.      The other brace of couriers was landed without incident and in full daylight.  The surf was not so heavy and a sand beach was backed in upon.  Major Sima and his comrade to-night will have carried great news to their companions and superior officers.
