We reached Gen. Cerbrico’s camp of Cuban soldiers with comparative ease.      He gave us an escort of five men when told our mission.  With them we rode six miles over steep mountains to another insurgent camp, where we slept.  The commandant increased our escort to fifteen men, and we started again at daybreak.      Another ride of about six miles over a difficult mountain path brought us to another Cuban outpost, encamped on some hills.  Across a little valley on the crest of opposing hills were the Spanish lines.  The camps were within easy rifle range of each other.      The insurgents were ragged and hungry.  For eight days they had subsisted on wild fruit, eked out with the flesh of a horse they had killed, and which, with their appetites, they had found very palatable.      About 5 A. M. we began to creep with as little noise as possible down the mountain, prowling through the lines of Spanish pickets.  We were forced to follow the beds of streams, as the dense chaparral was almost impassable.  We succeeded in escaping observation, and tramped for about 313 twelve miles without interruption.      These Cuban soldiers move through the woods silently and stealthily as Indians.  Their brown, naked shoulders and dirty garments show no color contrasts against the rocks or tree trunks.      Not a word was spoken above a whisper throughout the twelve miles.  Once we deployed into the woods to escape a Spanish detachment.  Then came a climb up a mountain 2,000 feet high.  At its summit success crowned our efforts. Clean and bright before us lay Santiago Bay, with every object pictured to our eyes with photographic distinctness. There upon the bosom of the green-fringed harbor lay Cervera’s once dreaded squadron. There were the four big warships, easily recognized—the Cristobal Colon, Vizcaya, Almirante Oquendo, Infanta Maria Teresa, and the old Reina Mercedes. Behind them lay the torpedo-boat destroyers and several small craft.      We could see the soldiers working on the fortifications and had an excellent bird’s-eye view of the city and its surroundings.  I climbed a tree and made a rough sketch of the scene before me, so that a working map could be made from it, and to fix the location of all important points firmly in my memory.      This done, our Cuban scouts began to show signs of nervousness at so long a stay in such close proximity to their enemies, the Spanish soldiers, and we began the weary homeward march.  The twelve hard miles were finally re- traversed, but not without adventure.  We passed within a few yards of a Spanish vidette post without alarming them. Nearing the insurgent camp we were fired on by our own friends, fortunately without injury.  The return to Cuero was without incident.      I have reported to Admiral Sampson the facts that we discovered.
