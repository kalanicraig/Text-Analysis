FINAL AND CLINCHING PROOF THAT MAINE WAS BLOWN UP        BY DESIGN, BY MINE OR TORPEDO, AS TOLD IN WORLD                THREE DAYS AFTER THE DISASTER.                             -----              Position of Ram Leaves No Room for                Doubt, Reasonable or Otherwise.                             -----          SHIP BROKEN IN TWO BY GREAT OUTSIDE FORCE.                             -----       Ponderous Ram Lies Almost at Right Angles to the              Still Intact Two-Thirds of the Hull                      Blown Away from It.                             -----               SOUNDINGS BY WORLD CORRESPONDENTS               REVEAL THIS MOST IMPORTANT FACT.                             -----     Explosion Against the Port Bottom Was Powerful Enough        to Break the Huge Steel Craft Like a Switch and             Hurl It Upward and Over to Starboard.                             -----          (Special from a World Staff Correspondent,     Sent from Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch                           Steamer.)       On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Confidence,           The World, Saturday, March 12, 1898, p. 1                                     Havana Harbor, March 11.      The discovery of the Maine's ram and its position relative to the rest of the wreck is the crowning proof that the ship was blown up by a mine or a huge torpedo.      There no longer is room for doubt, reasonable or unreasonable.      The ship is absolutely broken in two. Her heavy ram to-day points almost at right angles from the point of impact two-thirds of the way back. It points under water squarely at the Spanish cruiser Alfonso XII., which is at anchor away to the left of the wreck. It should point right ahead, at La Machina.      The queer phenomenon of the present position of the visible portion of the wreck is thus explained:      On Feb 15 the Alfonso XII. and the City of Washington immediately after the explosion lay very near the Maine, but pointed away to the left of the direction in which the visible portion of the wreck was found to point the next 159 morning.  Experts said that either an unaccountable current had held the Maine in a different position from that of the others while all were at anchor or the Maine was hurled away around toward the right by the force of an outside explosion against the port side well toward the forward end.      She was hurled away.  And the explosion against her port bottom was powerful enough to break the ship bodily and hurl it up and over to starboard at the point of greatest impact--about 100 feet (or one-third of the ship's length) from her ram.      The Maine's extreme forward point was a massive steel ram, a tremendously heavy structure.  It moved but little, and the portion of the ship between it and the point of explosion swung upon this ram, like a weight upon a fulcrum, away from the awful force applied against the port side. In the same manner the stern of the Maine was uninjured and moved little, while two hundred feet of the ship forward to the point of impact swung around to the right, away from the force.      And the Maine lies broken in two by a blow against her side as one might lay down a stick he had broken across his knee.      The discovery of the Maine's port bottom plate, with its split "Z" bar braces, its gusset plate, its sluice valve, its two inches of protective cement on the inside and its Higgins's green anti-fouling paint upon the outside, was proof enough.      It protrudes from the water fully twenty feet toward the centre of the ship from the proper position, and moved exactly toward the only interior explosive force of the ship powerful enough to do much damage there.  It was hurled into the ship and above the water by a tremendous explosion against it from the outside.      And now that the discovered ram shows the original position of the ship, the awful effects noted on great and small things are known to have come from exterior causes, aided, perhaps, by a single small interior magazine, as has been cabled.      Dinner hour for the naval men, the non-appearance of the Spanish divers and the fortunate absence of the patrol boats allowed The World's correspondents to work two hours with a sounding lead, compass and tape line.      For some time I had noticed that the navy divers were working away to port of the apparent position of the Maine's sunken bow.  They evidently had found something 160 big.  They did little work where the bow usually was supposed to lie.      To-day's soundings show nothing but mud and light wreckage where the bow ought to be.  But they do show a massive pointed object lying some eight feet above the mud, and pointing as indicated.  In the widest place it is about fourteen feet and runs to a point.      It is the Maine's ram, and now, by answering indirect questions, the experts admit it.      Careful soundings in approximate fourteen-foot squares show no wreckage on the port side of the forward portion of the wreck except the big iron ram.  Naturally, the mass of upper works went away to starboard, and this the Spanish divers probably have mistaken for the Maine's bow in its proper position.      The ram's position finally and definitely fixes the fact of a mine or a torpedo.
