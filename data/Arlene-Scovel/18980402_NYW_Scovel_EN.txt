SPANIARDS ARE BRAVE, LOYAL AND HARD FIGHTERS.                             -----        All Their Historic Valor Would Be Brought Into       Play in a War With Intensely Hated United States.                             -----      (By Cable from a Staff Correspondent of The World.)              (Despatch Passed by Havana Censor.)           The World, Saturday, April 2, 1898, p. 4                                      HAVANA, Cuba, March 28.      War with the United States would be extremely popular in Spain.      That Spain would lose ultimately is generally admitted, even by Spaniards themselves, but her soldiers and sailors would fight hard and fast as long as they have the men and the ships.      The unhappy experience of the Spanish army in Cuba has been wrongly attributed to cowardice and stupidity.  Those traits seem to form the prevailing American idea of what constitutes a Spanish soldier.      Spain is the most glorious loser in history, especially on the sea.  At Trafalgar the Spanish were heroes.  In books and in actions even England acknowledges it.      It is well that the people of the United States should realize fully that Spain has good ships and brave sailors to man them.      The World has clearly pointed out the real, the financial reasons, why Spain has not suffocated the insurrection in Cuba.  The Spaniards are not stupid, and from personal observation I can most emphatically state that Spanish soldiers and officers are not cowards, while in discipline and drill the Spanish sailors are better still.      I have seen Spaniards in action many times during my three years' experience in the Cuban war, but I never have seen a cowardly Spanish soldier.      Against the United States the peasantry of Spain would be united.  Even last June I found among the common people there, both in town and country, the same indignant rejection of the idea of selling Cuba to any one, the same resenting of American aid to the insurgents, the same eagerness to repel any foreign interference with their beloved Òpatrin.Ó      From an intimate acquaintance with the historic, 220 warlike spirit of Spain and the innate bravery of the people of the bull-fight, I believe that in case of war with the United States the Spanish soldiers of all ranks will put patriotism above the pocketbook and fight to the limit.
