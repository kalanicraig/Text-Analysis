LEE AT LAST GETS ORDERS TO RETURN.                             -----          He Will Leave Havana To-Day Between 2 and 5          O’Clock on One of the United States Vessels             Now There, with Many Other Americans.                             -----               PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE, SCOVEL SAYS,                 WAS DELAYED AT LEE’S REQUEST.                             -----      He Thought that the Embarkation of Citizens of This       County Could Be Better Accomplished if More Time            Was Given Before War Was Made Imminent.                             -----    (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World, Sent   from Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer.) On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Triton. The World, Saturday, April 9, 1898, p. 3                                      Havana Harbor, April 8.      A World correspondent has just started off to the Fern bearing Gen. Lee’s orders to Capt. Cowles for the departure to-morrow between 2 and 5 o’clock in the afternoon.      Gen. Lee’s long-looked-for instructions came finally this evening.      There are two American schooners, one steamship, the Evelyn, and the Bache and Fern here.  They will all go together.      The Olivette is expected to carry the balance of the reluctant naturalized American citizens.  Already 100 saloon passage tickets have been sold and by 5 o’clock to- morrow the little yacht-like boat will go out packed, jammed and packed again.      According to the instructions received by Gen. Lee from Washington any American citizen who cannot pay his passage will be carried free.           BRITISH CONSUL WILL GUARD OUR INTERESTS.      Day before yesterday British Consul-General Gollan received the formal instructions from Lord Salisbury that had been expected for several days and had been asked for by the State Department through Gen. Lee’s recommendation, and to-morrow morning, it is said, at 10 o’clock, will occur the formal transfer of the American consular papers and effects to the protection of the British representative. 239 As yet the news is only out partially, but there is great excitement amidst the Americans and their adopted brothers.      Ample protection is assured them by the Spanish authorities, and the embarkation promises to be made quietly and in order.              LEE REQUESTED TIME FOR EMBARKATION.      I now can absolutely state why the President’s message was delayed until Monday.  It was owing to the strong representations of Gen. Lee.      He thought the embarkation of Americans could be more quietly conducted if more time was given.  Such has been the case.      There is no excuse for any one who is left behind.
