SPAIN IS TRYING TO PROVE INTERNAL EXPLOSION.                             -----     Havana Officials Said to Have Offered Capt. Wylie, of     the Wrecking Tug Underwriter, a Large Sum of Money to      Testify that He Believed the Maine Blew Herself Up.            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)  (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World, Sent from  Havana to Key West by The World's Despatch Steamer Triton.) On Board The World's Despatch Steamer Triton, The World, Sunday, April 3, 1898, p. 3                                       Havana Harbor, April 2      In determining how the Maine was blown up, there are facts which should not be overlooked:      Was it known in Washington within a few days after the explosion that it was external?      The condition and location of the keel plates were apparent.  The World correspondent anticipated the testimony of Lieut. Powelson on this point.      The finding of the cement on the deck of the City of Washington occurred almost directly.      It has been proved that mines and mine cable had been stored in the arsenal, which disappeared shortly before the Maine's arrival.      Buoy No. 4 had not been used for some time before the Maine was moored to it.      Spain is grasping at each straw of possible evidence to buttress her feeble claims of an interior cause for the Maine's annihilation. This morning Spanish Inspector of Ships Perez and Second Inspector Puri boarded the wrecking tug Underwriter, as she lay careened against the mammoth barge Lone Star, alongside the Maine's disintegrating wreck. The Spanish press had cabled the authorities here that Capt. Wylie, of the Underwriter, had stated at Newport News upon his return from Havana that he was convinced upon a superficial examination that the Maine had blown herself up.      So Perez and Puri boarded the tug asked for the captain, and requested him to appear before the Spanish Investigating Committee to reiterate his former statements and swear to them.  It is understood that a considerable consideration was offered.  Capt. Wylie refuses to say whether he still thinks the Maine disaster was accidental 222 or whether he will swear to it before the Spanish Board.      It is not likely, though, that he will.  To a Fern officer he said that his Newport News remarks were misquoted.  He intimated now that he is convinced that the Maine was blown up as shown by the divers’ and experts’ evidence.  The straits in which Spain is forced to secure any testimony on her side of the question is shown by this attempt to secure alleged testimony from a tug captain, who had only been in Havana harbor two or three days and who is far from an expert in such matters. I have just discovered some slashing by the Spanish censor. I cabled a full account, couched moderately, of the Legaspi's flag episode. I told how her officers made an international code mistake in displaying any national colors over those of another nation, and how they speedily complied with Ensign Bookwalter's vigorous protest, authorized by Capt. Cowles, of the Fern. I now find that not one word of this was allowed to reach the cable office. The censor also eliminated the statement of the difficulty of extracting the valuable ten-inch guns from the wreck without the use of some dynamite, which being used in very small quantities, could not change the position of or destroy the remains of the Maine. The officered launches of Spain still keep close vigil over the wreck. They watch every movement.      The Havana newspapers now are proved guilty of deliberately falsifying the cable synopsis of the board's report.  They quoted the board as unable to form a definite idea of the condition of the wreck, clearly meaning all of the wreck while the real report as it now reaches Havana in The World shows that only the rear position of the Maine is to be meant by the phrase.      The divers, Lieut.-Commander Wainwright says, had not then investigated this part of the ship.  But the Havana press, seizing upon the statement, vociferously objected to the board's conclusions in every report if "they could not form definite ideas.” 223            BLANCO EXPECTS WAR AND RIOTS IN HAVANA.                             -----          He Has Made Preparations for the Former and                Will Try to Prevent the Latter.       (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World,                 sent from Havana to Key West               by The World’s Despatch Steamer.)                  Sunday, April 3, 1898, p.3.              On board The World’s Despatch Boat                Triton, Havana Harbor, April 2.      Havana is now excited over the news leaking from the Palace that Spain will not accede to McKinley’s demands. It is said she only has until Monday to decide.  I am in a position to state that Blanco expects war.  Not only does this information come through unimpeachable channels, but recent preparations for war were greatly hurried.  Blanco also expects anti-American and anti-autonomy riots in Havana.  Last night he called all the colonels of the Havana volunteers.  He told them that in the troublous times now to come he relied upon their coolness and patriotism to suppress disorders.  Inasmuch as Blanco is unable to secure the volunteers arms under the regular army guard the speech seems a forlorn hope.  The public shows symptoms of expectation of internal disorders.  The regular Thursday concert was very slimly attended.  Usually the promenade is filled with gayly dressed women.  Last night there was hardly one.  There were only men principally officers, and few of them.  The rumor here that Congress has given McKinley sixty hours to act aggressively has aided greatly in intensifying the present excited condition of affairs.      The World correspondent was politely received this morning by Capt. Eulate, of the Vizcaya before the Spanish warship sailed.  When asked his destination he replied: “I have sealed orders.  They are to be opened when clear out at sea.”      He was then asked if he was going to Puerto Rico. Eulate looked at the deck and said “No,” and changed the subject.      The Secretary of the Treasury yesterday afternoon paid $2,000,000 for rushed supplies for the army and navy.  I am informed that both services now have two months’ rations. This information comes from headquarters. 224 Again, a large force of boilermakers are working on the Alfonso XII.  If the steam-making apparatus is ever put in condition, this cruiser will be in very good shape. Although larger, she carries only about the same armament as the Montgomery.      The floating dock is now in readiness for cleaning the Spanish auxiliary cruiser Colon, one of the best boats of the company and of Spain’s merchant marine.
