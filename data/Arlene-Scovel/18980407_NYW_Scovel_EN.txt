LEE IN HAVANA, UNTERRIFIED, BUT OTHERS FLY.                             -----                   Three Steamers So Crowded                    That People Were Forced                       To Sleep on Deck.                             -----            AMERICAN PAPERS SEIZED BY PRESS CENSOR.                             -----                 Possibly No Regular Steamers               Between Key West or New York and                    Havana After This Week.                             -----         On Board The World’s Despatch Steamer Triton.            The World, Thursday, April 7, 1898 p. 1                                      HAVANA HARBOR, April 6.      Gen. Lee has not left Havana.      The Mangrove will leave at 6 o’clock this evening for Key West and will carry many Cuba-Americans who expect that war will be declared and who are anxious to escape from Cuba before hostilities commence.      The Mangrove will be crowded far beyond her regular capacity.  Many Cubans will have to spend the night on deck as there is no room for them in the cabin.      The Plant line steamer Mascotte left to-day for Tampa with more passengers than she ever carried before.  The Plant line agents here have cabled requesting permission to have the Mascotte discharge her passengers at Key West and return to Havana to-morrow for another load though, acting on Gen. Lee’s advice, the Plant line management has given official notification that the visits of their steamers to Havana would be discontinued after the Mascotte’s departure.      The Ward Line steamer Orizaba leaves this afternoon with twenty more passengers in the first-class cabin than she can accommodate with staterooms.  The agents of the Ward Line are hourly expecting notice from New York that no more Ward steamers will stop [. . .] Havana.      All American newspapers that arrived on the Mascotte early this morning were seized and taken to the palace. They have not yet been released by the censor.  The result is that it is impossible to obtain American newspapers to- day in Havana.      The American colony is in a state of great excitement. The [. . .] and Bache are lying ready to steam out at a moment’s notice when [. . .] Lee gives the word to hundreds 234 of scared naturalized citizens.      Lee, as usual, is cool, calm and easy-going.  His well worn advice is: “Keep cool and say nothing.”      He has full confidence that Blanco is strong enough to hold down the disorder and conduct the departure of Americans, if such has to be with all the possible international courtesy.  Politeness is now pushed to the last exquisite notch.      I am informed that a crowd of excessively goaded Americans privately hung Godkin in effigy here last night. He is regarded as a traitor. 235         MINE PRACTICE AT HAVANA BEFORE MAINE ARRIVED.                             -----         Experiments After Spanish Government Had Been                Notified That Our Warship Would                    Make a Friendly Visit.                             -----                FIFTY FLOATING MINES IN ARSENAL                TO-DAY, LOADED WITH GUN COTTON.                             -----    Eighteen “Mine Torpedoes” Like Those Planted Last Week      In the Channel at the Harbor Entrance Have Been Put         Aboard the Spanish Torpedo Catcher Filipinas.                             -----   (From One of The World’s Staff of Special Correspondents     in Cuba, Sent from Havana to Key West by The World’s                      Despatch Steamer.) On Board The World’s Despatch Steamer Triton. The World, Thursday, April 7, 1898, p. 1                                      Havana Harbor, April 6.      I have learned the kind and sizes of torpedoes and mines in the Spanish naval arsenal here.      I have learned also that some were experimented with the week before the Maine arrived.      Two strings of torpedoes were run across the narrow harbor entrance recently, as telegraphed to The World. They are placed as described, and are small floating boxes, two feet by one foot.  They are called here “mine torpedoes.”      There are in the arsenal to-day fifty “buoy” mines loaded with gun-cotton.      They are two shallow head spears placed together four feet each in diameter and each about two and a half feet thick.      Eighteen mine torpedoes similar to those recently placed in the entrance to the harbor were put aboard the torpedo chaser Filipinas yesterday.      The rumors that the officers of the Spanish transport Legazpi hauled down the Maine’s half-masted ensign are false.  The American colors were first hoisted clear to the peak, then taken down by Chief Quartermaster Hulgren, by order of Capt. Cowles, of the Fern.  The Spanish Admiral was notified of the fact. The ceremony took place at sunset. Then the Spanish banner dipped from the Alfonso XII. and the day formally 236 closed.  The officers and crew of the light-house tender Fern passed toward her, lowering the national flag and saluting.  Meanwhile the fluttering strips of bunting, all that was left of the Maine’s ensign, were being hauled clear to the top.  Then the crew of the Fern faced about and stood at a silent salute, while the historic tatters came slowly down.      A sinewy seaman descended the Maine’s single mast.  He had Capt. Sigsbee’s pennant between his teeth.  The insignium of command and the national colors reached the deck together.      The saluting hands on the Fern dropped and the United States battleship Maine ceased to officially exist.      She is no longer a bit of United States “soil,” according to naval usage; she is no more than the abandoned hulk of a wrecked merchantman.      There is half a million dollars' worth of uninjured machinery within her and four 10-inch guns still lie in the turrets.  They could not be secured without the use of prohibited explosives.  The guns when new cost $40,000 each.
