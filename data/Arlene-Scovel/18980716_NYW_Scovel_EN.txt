CONDUCT OF 71st NEW YORK                    AT CHARGE OF SAN JUAN.                             -----     Investigation Shows that the Men Were Ready to Fight,         but the Officers, Perhaps, Were More Modest.                             -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)           The World, Saturday, July 16, 1898, p. 1      PORT ANTONIO, Jamaica, July 15.—The report several days ago in regard to the officers of the Seventy-first New York Regiment has been patiently investigated by The World correspondent.      I am authorized by Lieut. Jackson and Major Reade, of Gen. Kent's staff, to make the following statement:      “When reinforcements were necessary to support the charge up San Juan heights Reade encountered the Seventy- first among the bushes to the left of the San Juan roads. He called: ‘If there is a man among you wearing shoulder straps who is not a coward, come out and show yourself.’ On being further urged by Capt. Ayres, in command of cavalry, Capt. Malcolm Rafferty stepped forward saying: ‘I'll obey any order coming from Gen. Kent.’  He led four companies up the hill, but after its capture by others.      “Reade also highly complimented Major Frank Keck, commanding the Third Battalion of the Seventy-first, for promptness in obeying the order to advance on the left road below Balloon Forks.  This battalion was also urged by Reade, assisted by Lieuts. Teyman, of the Twenty-fourth Infantry, and McArthur, of the Second.  Eight companies finally arrived at the top of the hill.      “After the action, while the regiments were formed along the road at night, Reade passed seeking the commanding officer.      “‘Where is the colonel?’      “‘Don't know,’ was the genial answer.      “‘Where's the lieutenant-colonel?’      “‘Don't know.’      “‘Where's the major commanding the first battalion?’      “‘Major Keck responded, saying he didn't know he was in command of the regiment, owing to the ranking officers not responding.      “The men of the Seventy-first are considered excellent raw material.  Many cases of individual courage and determination are cited.      “During the action, out of a total of sixty-two 340 missing in the entire division, forty-three were from the Seventy-first.      “Reade specially commended private Edwards, of Company 1, for voluntary, efficacious and unremitting care of the wounded and sick under fire."      The following facts are scrupulously gathered:  Col. Downs' orders on reaching the road near the hill were to take the regiment as far as possible.  This was passed along the line from the Second Cavalry.  Downs sent the answer along the line:  "I have taken the regiment as far as I can go.”      The Seventy-first at the time had the Second, Ninth, Tenth, Thirteenth and Twenty-fourth Regiments directly behind.  The regulars cursed the men of the Seventy-first and called them cowards.  They shouted:      “Let us go ahead, then!”      All this while the Spaniards were pouring in a fire of shell and Mausers.      The Seventy-first opened its ranks and the regiments above named passed through in double swing, jeering the Seventy-first, whose men showed good discipline, but were without orders.  They were stung by the jeers and boiling to go ahead.  The major of the Second Infantry, name unobtainable at present, shouted in passing: "For God's sake, boys, don't let it go back to New York that the Seventy-first didn't do its duty.  They need you--need you badly.  If officers won't take you,” he said, “either go as companies or go yourselves!”      Major Wills, of the Second Battalion of the Seventy- first, while the above officer spoke, told Capt. Goldsborough, Company M:      “I make you acting major of this battalion.”      Goldsborough formed the Second Battalion and part of the first in perfect order and led them through a break in the barbed-wire fence.  The orders were, “watch for the sharpshooters.”  Having some one to lead them, they went up the hill in good order. 341 OUR BOYS THINK THE SPANIARDS                  GOT OUT OF IT “DEAD EASY.”            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)           The World, Saturday, July 16, 1898, p. 1      AT THE FRONT, July 14, via Port Antonio.  July 15.—The news of the surrender of Santiago spread like lightning along the three miles down the road toward Siboney.      The regiments camped along this road were cheering for the surrender even before it was accomplished.  The Eighth Ohio gathered in mass and made the hills ring.  The fever patients in the ambulances shouted the good news to one another.      After the jubilation many sorrowful remarks were heard.  "The Spaniards are getting out of it dead easy," seems to be the burden of the American soldiers.      The fever is not on the increase.  Surgeon Jones reports two deaths on account of the men having been brought to the hospital from the front in a moribund condition.
