WORLD'S DIVERS                       AGAIN OFFERED TO                       RECOVER THE DEAD.                             -----         More than a Hundred Bodies in the Maine Wreck           Might Have Been Saved If the Tender, Made                Solely for Humanity's Sake, Had                        Been Accepted.                             -----                NAVAL DIVERS EMPLOYED INEXPERT,                  AND WORK IS UNSATISFACTORY.                             -----       Dead Seamen Packed Thick in Forward Part of Hulk,               Wedged in Among Tables, Boxes and                        General Debris.                             -----  (Special Cable Despatch from a World Staff Correspondent.)        The World, Tuesday, February 22, 1898, pp. 1, 2 HAVANA, Cuba.  Feb. 21.--It has been rainy to-day and dark. Very little work comparatively could be done on the wreck by Capt. Sigsbee's divers.  They are not accustomed to this water, which is inky even in bright sunlight.      The World's expert divers can work in all weather and under all physical conditions here.      The bodies of Lieut. Jenkins, Assistant Engineer Merritt and about a hundred others have not been recovered, although The World's offer of divers was made long enough ago to have insured the saving of them all, and most of them in a state of preservation to permit identification      Solely for the sake of humanity I handed to Capt. Sigsbee last night this letter:                  EVIDENCE OF A POWDER CASE.      A six-inch powder case was brought up to-day by divers at work in the forward end of the wreck.  All such cases habitually are kept in the six-inch magazines.      This is strong evidence that at least the rear one of the forward group of small magazines exploded.      The case, I am informed is ripped open and crumpled. It is of copper with a lapped-over seam, and contained brown powder with a few grains of black.                      THE WORLD'S OFFER. “To Capt. C.D. Sigsbee, Captain Commanding United States Warship Maine:      “Sir—In behalf of the New York World I again offer you the services of an expert diving crew of five Cuban 72 submarine divers for the sole purpose of securing for burial ashore the one-hundred-odd American sailors' bodies still entombed in the wreck of the second class battleship Maine, still under your direct command and still flying the United States flag and your pennant.  In law you are still in an uninterferable charge of the Maine as any commanding officer would be of any ship still in commission.      [. . .]--Sunday, Feb. 20, at five minutes past 1 o'clock P. M.—is the [. . .] day since the disaster, and neither the body of Lieut Jenkins nor that of Assistant Engineer Merritt, nor but one of the bodies of the martyr crew mentioned, has been taken from the wreck and the fishes.  The hundred-odd bodies already recovered have been found by Spanish patrol boats after wave action and decomposition alone had brought them to the surface, with the one exception of the single body found to-day while papers were being searched for.      “The United States Navy divers have been on the ground for thirty hours.  Their apparatus is defective or out of order and the men are not accustomed to the murky waters of Havana.  They have proved themselves unfortunately, incapable of rapid or even average submarine work.      “The diving crew I offer you and the Navy Department in behalf of The World have worked for years in Havana Harbor waters.  Indeed, the Merritt Wrecking Company, whose assistance you have asked and whose aid you can't have for at least forty-eight hours, employed these men to raise the sunken Ward liner Seneca in preference to their own employees.      “My men are native-born Cubans and may be thoroughly trusted to deliver any private or confidential State documents to yourself and yourself only.  These, however, your own men may be sent down for.      “The Cubans are willing to dive naked except for the diving helmet, as that your officers may be assured of their honesty.  Their simple apparatus, consisting of air- pump, hose, rope and diving helmet only, although it is sufficient to enable them to get all the bodies in the wreck, should they even wish to do so.  They can only descend to thirty-nine feet below low tide in Havana Harbor.      “I make this renewed offer in behalf of The World for no other person than humanity, the people of the United States in general, and the wishes of the families of the dead in particular.      “I hereby place these men absolutely and entirely at your disposal, transferring, if you wish, to the United 73 States Government my contact with the men.  You may quarter them aboard the United States Government boat Fern or the United States Government boat A. D. Bache, and deny access to them to any and all representatives of the press.  They will be United States divers, and the Spanish Government will have no further opportunity to object to “New York World interference.”      “I, therefore, in behalf of the nation they honor, in behalf of humanity and in behalf of their families, respectfully but earnestly request that you accept  this sincere and certain offer and secure at once the bodies of Lieut. Jenkins, Assistant Engineer Merritt and other heroic dead of the crew still under water in the ruins of your ship.      “I have, sir, the honor to be your very obedient servant.                                           “SYLVESTER SCOVEL,               “Representing the New York World. “Witness--I certify that the copy is correct.                                              “GEORGE ROLF.”                   COURT OF INQUIRY ARRIVES.      The Mangrove arrived at 9 A.M. to-day with the officers of the Naval Court of Inquiry.      The arrival of the Court of Inquiry gave the diving a fresh impetus, as it brought the Iowa's divers.  Yet the naval divers are not equal to the requirements.      The divers working to-day in the forward part of the shattered hull were Warrant Officer Morgan, of the New York, and the chief gunner's mate of the Iowa, under the charge of Ensign [Ba. . .mly]. The Maine’s diver, Reddin, and Fisher, of the New York, were working in the undestroyed stern of the Maine.      Lieutenant-Commander Wainwright still is in general charge.                 SHIP'S SILVER SERVICE SAVED.      From the cabin of Capt. Sigsbee, which is the most accessible part of the wreck, numerous articles have been recovered, among others a bicycle, some swords, the enlistment record of E. L. Noble, a fireman, now dead, and Capt. Sigsbee's silver service plate, presented by the State of Maine.  Still further down in the ship were found half a dozen packages of chewing gum.  The work has been almost by torch, although now, I am informed, the Mangrove has run an electric wire over the wreck, rigged with lamps.      The forward divers had perilous work.  The Maine really is chewed up there, and there was great danger of the air hose being sawed by the ragged plate edges, and of 74 the life line getting afoul of wreckage.                  HORRORS CONFRONTING DIVERS.      The divers say this part of the ship is awful.  Bodies are packed between tables, boxes and beams.      They fall almost to pieces when touched, and many of them can never be taken out.  Nearly all could have been saved intact by The World's divers on Thursday and Friday.      Several cases of canned good were found, their contents mingled with coal and an awfully complex debris.      Nothing has been done to-day toward ascertaining the cause of the explosion.  The real cause cannot be actually proved until it is learned whether the top of the forward turret is on or not.  It was over the main magazine and was thrown into the harbor away from the ship.      The divers worked to-day from 9 o'clock to noon and from 1 to 3:30.      The new outfit consists of one double air pump and two diving suits.                   SIGBEE'S REQUEST GOES BEGGING.      Capt. Sigsbee sent day before yesterday a formal request for the privilege of beginning diving on the United States second-class battle-ship Maine. The messenger went to the Spanish warship Alfonso XII., then to the Admiral, then to the Captain of the Port, then to the Admiral, and failed to get an answer. Capt. Sigsbee asked yesterday for permission to investigate the outside of the wreck, but the permission was not granted.      Consequently no absolute proof has been secured yet as to whether the forward magazine exploded or not.      The Chapman-Merritt Company's powerful wrecking tug Neptune is expected early to-morrow.  She has big pumps and heavy cranes for hoisting up the Maine's big guns, and the turrets, too, perhaps.  She will be useless unless permission is granted for her to work outside the wreck, for the turrets are there.                  MAY NEVER BE ACCOUNTED FOR.      About fifty men sleeping in the centre of the Maine on the berth dock probably never will be accounted for.  They must have been blown to pieces.      The divers already have seen some skeletons of bodies which the vultures had picked clean while floating under the ruins where the Spanish patrol boats could not get them.      One hundred and forty-three bodies in all have now been recovered.      Consul-General Lee has notified Gen. Blanco and the Spanish Admiral that the American Naval Court of Inquiry 75 will call officially to-morrow at 10 A.M., explaining that the officers have come here in such a hurry that they will have to appear in plain clothes.      Zalinski's theory that chains will be found on the bottom near the wreck is not believed in here, the torpedo- only theory decreasing.  No known dirigible torpedo could do such havoc over such a wide area.      The investigating of the inside of the wreck and of the outside--if Spain's kind permission is given--will be pushed to-morrow.  Conflicting rumors will cease soon, and just what caused the Maine's annihilation will be known.                 THE WOUNDED IN THE HOSPITALS.      Koehler and Holzer, in the San Ambrosio Hospital, are very low.  Koshler is delirious all the time.  Holzer has received the last sacrament from Chaplain Chidwick.      The six others in that hospital are doing well.  Some can read and smoke when some one holds the cigarettes for them.  All have burned arms and hands, but all are brave and patient.      In the Alfonso XIII. Military Hospital, a new and sanitary structure, there are three of the Maine's wounded. They are doing well.      One, named Weber, said to Chaplain Chidwick to-day:      "Oh, no! Chaplain, we are not afraid of dying here except from the gout."      They are being very well looked after.             WHY THEY WERE NOT TAKEN TO CLARA BARTON'S.      Surgeon Henneberger explains the reason why Clara Barton's house in Buenos Aires is not used for the wounded instead of San Ambrosio Hospital by stating that the patients could be moved aboard a ship by water much easier than to Miss Barton's house ashore.  Each will be moved there, he says, when he is able.      The graceful courtesy of the Spanish surgeons is shown by a sign posted at the entrance to the hospital ward where the Maine's sufferers are.  It reads:      "Take off your hat upon entering this room."      This is an unusual thing for this country, where one walks into the theatre with his hat on.      The Spanish Red Cross deserves praise for having assisted on that terrible Tuesday night.  It sent stretchers to the Machura for the immediate transport of the wounded to the hospital.                 LATEST MYSTERIOUS EXPLOSION.      After the cable office closed last night a dull explosion was heard in this city, and there was great excitement for a few moments. 76 It being carnival time the streets were thronged, all the theatres and all the clubs had dances.  Everybody started for the water front.  The sound seemed to come from the bay.      On passing a police station I saw a wounded man being carried from a carriage.  He was Gonzalez Jorin, who had a hole in his left knee from a piece of roof tile which had been hurled by the explosion of a small petard on the top of a small building adjoining the Irijoa Theatre.      The wounded people were in the balcony of the theatre watching the carnival ball and were struck by flying pieces coming through an open window.  About half a dozen were injured.      The explosion probably was a case of private revenge. There is much hatred between the various dance places in carnival time.      Many of the most curious stories are floating about. One man says he was sleeping in one of the Maine's boats—he doesn't know on which side of the ship—when he felt an awful shock and found himself aboard the burning ship.                 CARNIVAL CLOSE TO A FAILURE.      This year's carnival is very weak among the better classes.  There has been a very small turn-out.  The war has impoverished everybody.      Bullets flew in one of the two principal dancing places.  Two persons were badly wounded.      The Diario de la Marina assailed the American press and correspondents bitterly again yesterday for "interfering in international questions."  The World's offer of divers caused it.      La Lucha says Secretary-General Congosto has sent a report to Washington on the Maine disaster.
