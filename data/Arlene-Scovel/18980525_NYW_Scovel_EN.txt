PLUCKY LONDON TIMES MAN                 STARTS FOR HAVANA IN A PUNT.                             -----       Carried by The World Despatch-Boat Triton Within           Seven Miles of Havana, He Departed on His                  Perilous Trip to the Enemy.            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)           The World, Wednesday, May 25, 1898, p. 2      KEY WEST, Fla., May 24.—E. W. Knight, correspondent of the London Times, left The World despatch boat Triton in a small boat between Key West and Cuba yesterday for a perilous trip to Havana.  He had Secretary Long’s permission to land.  Blanco has acquiesced, and to-day he is safe in the blockaded city, if he was not upset.      Mr. Knight once sailed half around the globe in a twelve-ton sloop and wrote a book about it.  He embarked to-day in a twelve-foot flat-bottomed, low-sided cockle shell of a skiff.  The wind was blowing half a gale against the Gulf Stream.      The Triton lay near the shore, but the sea was still nasty.  Knight, moreover, had the usual Englishman’s quota of baggage.  The rowing thwart was too high for his long knees to clear the oars.  He thereupon sat flat in the skiff’s bottom and from the side looked as though he were seated upon the seat, the boat’s sides were so low.      Besides his baggage, Knight’s alleged boat bore three bottles of mineral water, some whiskey and a white flag.  A British ensign he carried in his pocket.      Off Barcurinao Cove, at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, Knight and his outfit were manoeuvred into the little craft.  He started paddling vigorously for Havana, seven miles distant, westward along the coast.      The mate said: “That feller will never see shore.” Indeed, the second sea which raced by us completely doused him.  But up he bobbed upon it, saying as he paddled away: “Good-by and thanks.  I fancy I am all right now, you know.”      The Triton’s crew and passengers saluted him, and in less than five minutes so frothy and so high was the sea that Knight disappeared from sight.  He is to make every effort to see that The World correspondent and artist, Thrall and Jones, are speedily forthcoming when the two Spanish prisoners reach Havana under a flag of truce.      If he tired of rowing and made for shore short of 304 Havana, he probably ran into Spanish cavalry and was sent to Cabanas to meet The World men as their fellow-prisoner, before his documents were examined.      Officers of the blockading fleet are earnestly watching for something to capture and are anxious for news of the expected south coast naval battle.  Their opinion is that as now divided either Sampson’s or Schley’s ships are more powerful than Spain’s four protected cruisers and three destroyers.      By this time the busy Tecumseh will have picked up Major Sima, his escort and his information.  As cabled exclusively, these Cuban couriers were landed by Lieut. Evans two days ago to communicate with important Cuban forces.      While approaching shore yesterday afternoon, heavy clouds of white smoke rolled out from Santa Clara battery. They were followed by a lesser one from San Diego battery, on the hill between Morro and Cojima.  No American ships could be discovered within range, and no shells dropped near the Triton.  The Spaniards seemed at target practice.
