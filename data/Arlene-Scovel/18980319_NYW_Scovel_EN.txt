The World, Saturday, March 19, 1898, p. 2      HAVANA HARBOR, March 18.—Until Capt. Converse’s explanation appears it must be considered disagreeably true that the American ship Montgomery has violated naval usage in general and the United States Navy Blue Book in particular.  It seems she dipped her national colors to the Vizcaya and Oquendo, and that they merely answered the unprecedented salute.      Section 118 of the American naval regulations says: “No ship of the navy shall lower her sails or dip her ensign unless in return for such compliments.”      But one flag can ever be placed above the national banner, and that is the church flag, with its blue cross, which denotes that there are religious services aboard.      In fact, on no occasion is a man-of-war supposed to lower the colors, except as a signal of surrender in battle.  The Montgomery’s action is unacceptable.                NO CRITICISM OF CAPT. CONVERS.      American officers here say that the adept Capt. Converse could not possibly have known about it, even though he could not fail to see the Vizcaya’s and Oquendo’s flag salute in passing.  It is argued that Capt. Converse might have thought the Spaniards saluted first, not having seen some stupid quartermaster raising and lowering the American colors.  On the little Fern the most important American officers here were seated.  They saw the Montgomery’s ensign dipping.  One exclaimed:      “My God, what’s that ship doing!” 188               AMERICAN OFFICERS WERE CHAGRINED.      There followed exasperated comment.      Both Admiral Manterola and Capt. Eulate, of the Vizcaya, courteously received a World correspondent early this morning. Mantirola said that he had gone aboard the Oquendo to see that the usual formal forming of the marine guard was properly done in honor of the Montgomery’s departure. He saw the American ensign dipped three times to the Vizcaya. She had hardly finished answering when the Montgomery dipped again three times to the Oquendo. The little cruiser was passing so fast that her dipping was practically continuous.      The Spanish Admiral appeared very much pleased and concluded:      “We considered it, and do consider it, a very great compliment.”      Capt. Eulate said: “The Montgomery honored us with a salute.”  He was also rejoiced.                TWO BODIES AND A GUN RECOVERED.      Two bodies were brought up to-day from the forward part of the wreck.  One was fully dressed and can probably be identified.  The body is in a wonderful state of preservation, and, like all the others bears no marks of fish nibbling.      The wrecking company diver, Edward Hickman, brought up the bodies.  He also broke out the six-pounder rapid-fire bow gun which was recovered to-day.  It was hanging downward from the superstructure of the deck upon which it had been located, having been folded over.  The navy divers are working aft, clearing the cabins of valuables.  They expect to hoist the six-inch guns Monday.               DRY GUN-COTTON FOUND BY A DIVER.      Gunner Morgan found the dry gun-cotton to-day.  Its place was in the captain's cabin and it was put up in glass tubes.  It was the most detonative material aboard.  It is still dry.  The bottles are uninjured.      Now that gun-cotton has been secured, dynamite may be used in releasing the big, valuable ten-inch guns.  They may not be seriously damaged.  The small guns brought up are in fair condition, except those near the point of greatest heat.      Spanish divers were down a long while this afternoon. They say they are still looking for the Maine's ram.          AUSTRIANS PLACE A WREATH OVER MAINE'S DEAD.      Only now has a most thoughtful action been discovered. Tuesday a beautiful wreath of flowers was placed upon the graves of Maine’s dead in Colon Cemetery by the officers of 189 the Austrian training ship Donau.  The raw mounds of earth bear their flowers and six-foot streamers of red and white ribbons bearing the words, “Our unfortunate comrades of the Maine.”      The Donau was at New Orleans when the Maine disaster occurred.  Her captain immediately half-masted his colors, and now most gracefully finished the act of honor by this floral touch of sympathy.      A committee composed of Capt. Ludwig Ritter von Hohnel, Lieutenant-Commander Baron Wetsler von Plankerstern, Lieut. Ritter von Thierry, the chief engineer, the paymaster, two junior lieutenants, four midshipmen and four sailors in fatigue uniform, left the ship, drove to the cemetery and placed the wreath on the graves of their comrades.      The ceremony took place Tuesday.  This act of courtesy on the part of the officers and men of the Austrian warship will forever live in the minds of our people as a gracious act.
