GEN. SHAFTER AND SYLVESTER SCOVEL.                             -----         The Correspondent's Account of His Encounter               with the General at Santiago—Gen.                     Shafter's First Blow.          The World, Wednesday, August 10, 1898, p. 4 To the Editor of The World:      Gen. Shafter struck me in the face.  The blow was stinging, quick, and absolutely unlooked for.  I answered it.      Such was my offense in the public square of Santiago after the close of the entrance ceremonies July 17, 1898.      I had not signed the “Articles of War,” never having applied for a military license.  Nevertheless, I was under military control, and should have borne Gen. Shafter's blow.  Whether Gen. Shafter had any provocation for striking me appears in the following detailed account of the whole affair.  Enough men cognizant of the matter are now in New York to substantiate this presentation of an incident whose occurrence I naturally greatly regret.  I have awaited their coming before making any statement whatsoever to the public.  Meanwhile, the published accounts have been false, inasmuch as they have told only half the truth.      Had I really done the things generally ascribed to me I should and certainly would have been shot.  Grant would have ordered a court-martial for that purpose.  Shafter would surely have done so.      Shortly before the American flag was to be raised over Santiago palace I assisted Lieut. Miley to gain the roof where was the flagstaff.  Gen. Shafter's son-in-law, a civilian appointee, [. . .] Lieut. Wheeler, son of Gen. Wheeler, were already there.  There was no prohibition, expressed or implied, as to my going upon the roof.  Soon after Lieut. Miley ascended I gained the extreme rear portion of the roof--practically another part of it.  My head and shoulders alone were above the ridge.  I was fully thirty feet from the flagstaff, was out of sight from the officers in the square below, and could been seen only from the extreme opposite side of the square.  In no sense was I an intruder and certainly I had no such intention.  I had chosen that position to be able to observe accurately every movement in the raising of the flag, and make that the feature of my account of the ceremonies.  This minute observation could not be had from the square below on 346 account of a low parapet.      Lieut. Wheeler saw me on the roof, bowed and smiled. He saw nothing wrong in my position.  Later Capt. McKittrick, Gen. Shafter's son-in-law, turned and saw me taking notes.  He asked Lieut. Miley:  “Who is that man?”      I answered, giving my name.  Lieut. Miley ordered me down.  Why this staff officer disliked me is another story, entailing as it does the telling of the shameful reasons why we lost so many men at the taking of San Juan, Cuba.      I obeyed the order to leave the roof, but did not move as quickly as Lieut. Miley wished, and he called down to Gen. Shafter: “There is a man on the roof who won't get down.”  The answer was: “Throw him down.”  But even before Lieut. Miley had spoken to the General I was upon the tree which served as a ladder.  Before he had finished I had descended and stood in the palace door, where a throng was gathered watching the soldiers.      The flag ascended, the band played the “Star-Spangled Banner,” and then every one formally congratulated Gen. Shafter as representing a victorious nation.  After the principal congratulations Mr. De Armas, of the Sun, proposed to Gen. Shafter that the soldiers be allowed to cheer the flag.  I seconded the suggestion made by Mr. De Armas.      Gen. Shafter seemed pleased and stepped toward the ranks.      All the men watched him.  He spoke to an officer there.  That officer turned about, faced the lines, and called for “three cheers for Gen. Shafter.”  The men smiled.  They cheered faintly.  The commander-in-chief became intensely irritated.  Apparently the officer had misunderstood Gen. Shafter's order, and either that fact or the faint response to the call for cheers infuriated his chief.      Although I noticed Gen. Shafter's anger I did not heed as much as I should have that he was very angry.  What chiefly concerned me at the moment was that presently I should have to leave the palace to forward my despatches, and I sincerely desired to make an early explanation to Gen. Shafter concerning my presence on the roof.  Had I paused to consider how Gen. Shafter was more than merely annoyed by the blunder as to the cheering, I should, of course, have recalled that it was an inopportune moment to make my desired explanation to him.  And so unfortunately, while he was yet angry I approached him.      Before I had finished explaining to him that I was the man who had been on the roof, but that I certainly had no 347 intention of causing any trouble there, he used the most violent language in denouncing all correspondents as liars and nuisances.  His exact words are not fit for publication.      I should have remained silent.  According to military custom a subordinate should put his feelings in his pocket. But I told Gen. Shafter he should not use such language to me.  He had taken a step away while I spoke, but now he turned very quickly for one of his weight—he weighs 310 pounds and I weigh 130 pounds--and with the force of his swing and an advancing step William R. Shafter Major- General, commanding the Fifth Army Corps, struck me a full- arm blow in the face.      Of the previous thirty hours I had been in the saddle eighteen, had slept four and had worked hard the others.  I had eaten nothing for eighteen hours.      I had neither the strength nor the nerve to stiffen myself against such a sudden, unexpected blow, and thoughtlessly, without premeditation and on the natural impulse of the moment, I returned it.  I was quickly drawn away by several staff officers, and I said to Gen. Shafter exactly this:  “You--a major-general--commanding a United States Army--you ought to be ashamed of yourself.”  I said nothing else.  Many heard and saw all that took place.      The General then said, “Take a file of soldiers and detain that man.  Let no one see him.”  He took a step toward the palace, stopped, turned, and said, “Let no one speak to him.”  Another step.  Gen. Shafter stopped and said, “Let no one come anywhere near him.”      And finally, the fourth time, the General, now quite near the palace door, shouted.  “You be sure that no one comes near that man.”      I was handed over to the Spanish authorities and placed, incommunicado, in the town jail.      If I had been the aggressor, if I had been alone in the wrong, I cannot doubt nor will any one who knows Gen. Shafter doubt, that I would have been court-martialed for my life.      The next morning I was courteously conducted to Siboney by officers of Gen. McKibben's staff and the next day my detention ceased, as I boarded the transport Hudson, bound North.      Such is the full and true story of my encounter with Gen. Shafter.
