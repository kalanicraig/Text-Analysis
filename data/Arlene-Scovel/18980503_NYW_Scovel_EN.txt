SCOVEL GOES TO SOLVE FATE OF CO-WORKERS.                             -----        Brave Correspondent Starts to Join Gomez and to         Find, if Possible, Some Trace of The World's                      Special Commission.                             -----                   TORPEDO-BOAT PORTER LANDS                  HIM SAFELY ON CUBAN COAST.                             -----  Has a Secret Commission from Admiral Sampson to Fulfill—How          He Hopes to Reach the Insurgent Camp—Porter                 Chases Two Spanish Gunboats.                             -----            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)     NORTHERN COAST SANTA CLARA PROVINCE, CUBA, April 30.                                   By Way of Key West, May 2.             The World, Tuesday, May 3, 1898, p. 8      I am off to find Gomez and The World's commission.      For two hours the torpedo-boat Porter has ranged along the coast, but no sign of The World's men have been seen. We have signalled and signalled.  No answer.  Not a flutter of white anywhere.      So a small boat has been launched and willing tars have pulled five hard, broiling miles to this point.  It is a small town, called El Embarcadero de Mayajagua.  There are Spanish forces near.      They may have captured Major Smith, of Gen. Gomez's bodyguard, who was in charge of The World party.      They may have captured the party itself, composed of Nichols, Hare and Whigam.      The last I saw of them they were sailing shoreward near Caibarien in a little fishing smack on April 24. Everything seemed in their favor then, but one of the two gunboats we sighted to-day may have captured them.      At any rate, there is no sign of them at this, the appointed place.      Wright and myself are going in after them--Wright because he thinks little of hardship and danger, and I because I have the Admiral's commission to fulfil.      H. C. Seppings-Wright is the war artist of the London Illustrated News.      The men are now hiding our saddles.  If we meet the Cubans soon we expect to return with horses and then easily get off for Gomez. 
284 If not, we go on foot to the southeast, hoping to meet Cubans on the way.      At 10.45 this morning the Porter entered the Caibarien Canal. Two little Spanish gunboats hurried away to a Caibarien port. They did not like the looks of the Porter.      The Porter brought war to this part of the Cuban coast.  She chased the gunboats.  They flaunted the yellow and red bunting.      The crew of the Porter were wide-awake and anxious for fight.  Even the engineers poked their heads above the hatches to get momentary glimpses of the gunboats, but they are safe.      Lieut. Fremont was watching the shore closely, and after the chase was over the Porter moved slowly for several miles along the coast, looking for some sign of The World's party, but in vain.
