They will remain there for a few days and will then return here, as there is further testimony to be secured from the divers on the Underwriter and the wrecking barge Chief.      Capts. Sampson and Chidwick, Lieut.-Commander Potter and Judge Advocate Marix paid their respects to Gen. Lee just before departure.      The wrecking tug Underwriter is expected to leave for the North to-night, to return with a 3,000-ton lighter, and will then push the work vigorously.  During the absence of the board in Key West the divers will occupy the barge Chief together.  The divers are now working, and say they will be prepared to lay lots of additional evidence before the court on its return.
