FLAG OF TRUCE SENT BY                     SAMPSON TO SANTIAGO.            (Special Cable Despatch to The World.)            The World, Tuesday, June 14, 1898, p. 1 PORT ANTONIO, Jamaica, June 13.—The collier Kingston, Lieut. Speyers, arrived this noon with Admiral Sampson’s despatches about the Guantanamo cable cutting and the fight yesterday; also the mission of a flag of truce at Santiago yesterday afternoon, supposedly carried by the Vixen. Lieut. Speyers said he knew nothing of the character or object of the mission.      The Kingston expected to return immediately to Santiago, but Washington cabled her to wait further orders.      No objection was raised by the authorities to the Kingston taking ship’s provisions. The officers of the British war-ship Indefatigable were prompt in making an official call on the Kingston.      Jamaica sentiment is strongly American.      The authorities anticipate Spanish objection to having Port Antonio used as an American base.  The press boats are carefully watched to prevent them from carrying despatches and have been warned that if caught they will be allowed to take on no coal or supplies.
