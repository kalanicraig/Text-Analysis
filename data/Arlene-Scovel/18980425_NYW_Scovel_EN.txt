WORLD’S TUG TRITON REPORTS TO ADMIRAL SAMPSON.                             -----      (Special from a Staff Correspondent of The World.) On Board The World’s Despatch Steamer Triton, The World, Monday, April 25, 1898, p. 2                                   Key West Harbor, April 24.      The Triton ran close to the flagship New York early Saturday morning carrying maps and information for Commander-in-Chief Sampson.      The liberty was taken of running close to the fleet while signaling was in progress, because the Triton, with the ten Lee straight-pull navy rifles and the Colt’s navy revolvers, which had been furnished us by the commander as some protection in the coast work we had been doing was for the time a species of Government vessel.      The answer to our hail came megaphoned out:      “We’ll take you aboard when we get nearer shore,” and we knew Havana was to be blockaded.  This was the first time the Triton had been with the fleet since the warships had left the Key West anchorage, the Triton having been engaged in scouting duty along the coast of Cuba for Admiral Sampson.  In all three trips had been made.      The big ships were strung out in line, headed for Morro.  The torpedo-boat Porter followed the flagship like a hunting dog at heel.      The warships were stripped of all superfluities and trimmings.  Hatches, boats and woodwork generally had been left at Key West.  The battleships forged along at half speed in the full beauty of their naked stead.  The crews were restless.  They didn’t know that the propellers would stop before the puffs of smoke and the grinding whizz of Santa Clara’s big projectiles would bring them into action and to their guns.  What they had discussed in the forecast and on watch, ashore and afloat, for years, they thought was going to happen.  There was to be a fight.      The men didn’t lean over the rail, for there was none to lean upon, and instead of squatting on deck they kept moving, moving.  Men have to get tuned up higher in these days of steel.      So when the American jackies saw Morro Castle’s gray walls and the yellow streaks of the newly banked sand of Cojimar’s modern batteries, and then looked about upon the 264 stripped steel of their ships, they were restless.      They had been on edge for two months waiting for the great day when they would go under full steam for Havana.      When these lads found that there was only to be a blockade they were mad all the way through.  A moment before they had been willing to drop dead by the gun or to sink with the ship; now they began a lusty swearing.  They foresaw a scarcity of “fresh grub” and absolutely no shore leave.      The morale of the officers and men is high, but they do want to get at the Spaniards.
